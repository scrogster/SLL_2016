This repository contains all data and code necessary to reproduce the numerical results contained in: 

Scroggie, M.P, Peterson, G.N.L., Rohr, D.H., Nicholson, E. & Heard, G.W. (2019) "Disturbance has benefits as well as costs for fragmented populations of a cryptic grassland reptile". *Landscape Ecology* [doi: 10.1007/s10980-019-00865-0](https://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10980-019-00865-0)

Just another Gibbs Sampler (JAGS) is used to fit the Bayesian dynamic occupancy model to the data using Markov Chain Monte Carlo methods, and should be downloaded and installed from:

[https://sourceforge.net/projects/mcmc-jags/files/](https://sourceforge.net/projects/mcmc-jags/files/)

Fitting the model takes approximately 1 hour.

The included *Makefile* describes all required steps to format the data, fit the statistical model and generate the tables and figures.
