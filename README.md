This repository contains all data and code necessary to reproduce the numerical results contained in: 

Scroggie, M.P, Peterson, G.N.L., Rohr, D.H., Nicholson, E. & Heard, G.W. "Disturbance has benefits as well as costs for fragmented populations of a cryptic grassland reptile".

Just another Gibbs Sampler (JAGS) is used to fit the Bayesian dynamic occupancy model to the data using Markov Chain Monte Carlo methods, and should be downloaded and installed from:

[https://sourceforge.net/projects/mcmc-jags/files/](https://sourceforge.net/projects/mcmc-jags/files/)

Fitting the model takes approximately 1 hour.

The included *Makefile* scripts all required steps to format the data, fit the statistical model and generate the tables and figures.
