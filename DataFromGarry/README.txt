Season_Burn_Summary.txt

contains our best effort to summarise the various fire data for the sites.

it tells us how many burns in summer, winter, autumn, spring and in total for all sites known to have been burnt during the study.

This has been gleaned from DELWP's Actions for Biodiversity Conservation database, the DELWP FIREHISTORY GIS layer, and from additional
data compiled by the authors from discussion with land managers, fire brigades and other sources.
