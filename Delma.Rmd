**Aim:       ** In fragmented landscapes, conservation practitioners face complex decisions as they seek to maximize the viability of populations. Effective decision-making is often hampered by a lack of knowledge regarding the relative contributions of patch sizes, habitat characteristics, disturbance regimes and the spatial arrangement of habitat on the occupancy dynamics and viability of populations. We sought to determine the drivers of occupancy, persistence and colonisation for populations of the pygopodid lizard *Delma impar* inhabiting remnant native grassland.

**Location:     ** A fragmented native grassland landscape in south-western Victoria, Australia.

**Methods:    **  We monitored patch occupancy of the endangered pygopodid lizard *Delma impar* at 291 grassland sites in western Victoria, Australia for nine years. The monitoring data were analysed using a dynamic occupancy model which allowed for imperfect detection. We used the model to assess hypotheses regarding the effects of patch characteristics, disturbance regimes and spatial arrangement of habitat on the occupancy dynamics of the species.

**Results:     ** At the outset of the study, site occupancy was positively associated with the extent of surrounding native grassland habitat and the presence of clay-rich soils. Roadside habitats were also more likely to be occupied. Subsequent population persistence was positively associated with fire and livestock grazing, two key disturbance processes in these grassland systems. Colonisation of unoccupied habitat was more likely when the surrounding landscape contained large amounts of native grassland. Over the course of our study the number of occupied sites declined, as rates of colonisation of vacant sites did not balance the rate at which populations went extinct.

**Main conclusions:     ** Our results illustrate the value of long-term dynamic occupancy data for investigating the drivers of species persistence in fragmented landscapes. Conservation of *D. impar* populations in fragmented grassland habitat will require imposition of appropriate fire and grazing regimes, and is most likely to be successful in parts of the landscape where extensive networks of native grassland habitat are retained.

# Introduction

The dynamics of patch occupancy within fragmented landscapes reflect the collective results of several inter-related ecological processes. Populations inhabiting small fragments experience stochastic extinctions due to a combination of small-population processes, unsuitable habitat features or management regimes [@hanski1996quantitative; @ferraz2003rates; @franken2004influence; @hanski2011habitat; @robles2012influence]. At the same time, varying rates of migration into fragments as a consequence of variation in inter-fragment distance and matrix permeability produce differential rates of migration and colonisation among habitat fragments [@ricketts2001matrix; @gaggiotti2004combining; @cosentino2011spatial]. In combination, these processes determine whether either a balance is achieved between rates of population extinction and colonisation or alternatively occupancy declines and metapopulations collapse as populations succumb to local extinctions at a faster rate than can be offset by migration and population establishment [@hanski1999habitat].

Typically, the processes of local extinction and colonisation are not spatially or temporally homogeneous, but vary in space and time, subject to historic, natural and management processes occurring at differing spatial and temporal scales. The challenge for practitioners managing such systems for conservation is to determine which ecological and management processes are important drivers of patch occupancy while being amenable to management. With this knowledge, appropriate management can then be implemented. 

Particularly challenging are decisions focussed on disturbance regimes. Perturbations such as fire, storms, grazing and drought are increasingly recognised as key drivers of ecosystem function in fragmented landscapes [e.g., @ross2002changes; @turner2005landscape; @laurance2008impacts]. For some species, frequent disturbance is vital for metapopulation persistence [e.g., @jakalaniemi2006conservation; @templeton2011transition], while in others disturbance can lead to rapid metapopulation collapse [e.g. @lindenmayer1995modelling]. Moreover, both positive and negative effects of disturbance can be manifest for a given species, resulting from a reliance on disturbance regimes to maintain habitat structure or food resources, but a threshold of disturbance scale, intensity and frequency beyond which those mechanisms break down  [@snall2005modelling; @stelter1997modelling]. Understanding such relationships is vitally important for effective conservation management when disturbance regimes can be at least partially controlled by managers, as if the case for disturbance processes such as fire and grazing.

In recent decades, patch-occupancy dynamics of habitat-specialists have made a substantial contribution to our understanding of the ecological processes governing species persistence in fragmented landscapes [@hanski1997metapopulation; @ehrlich2004wings; @hanski2004ecology]. Here, we use nine years of occupancy data for an Australian grassland specialist, the Striped Legless Lizard (*Delma impar*) to examine the effects of habitat patch characteristics, disturbance regimes and spatial arrangement of habitat on metapopulation viability.

Native temperate grassland was widespread in south-eastern Australia at the time of European settlement (c. 180 yr BP), but has been systematically destroyed and degraded through livestock grazing, cultivation, invasion of exotic plants and urban development [@lunt2002grasslands; @williams2007ela]. Only a small fraction of the original extent of this vegetation type remains, chiefly in the form of small, isolated remnants, most of which are not formally reserved or managed for conservation. Legal and illegal destruction of remnant grassland also continues, in spite of widespread recognition of the parlous conservation status of this vegetation type and it's distinctive biota, and legislative and regulatory frameworks for the protection of remnants [@williams2005fil; @williams2005pta;  @williams2007ela].

The extent of historic destruction and degradation of native temperate grassland in south-eastern Australia has lead *D. impar* and other grassland-specialist flora and fauna to undergo profound reductions in extent of occurrence [@recoveryplan]. While it is well established that populations of *D. impar* persist within grassland fragments across the species' historic range, it is not known with certainty whether the species is continuing to decline. Although it has been hypothesised that habitat loss, fragmentation and inappropriate disturbance regimes may adversely effect populations of *D. impar* [@recoveryplan; @howland2014eaten], formal, quantitative assessment of the habitat and management requirements for ensuring population persistence have not been conducted.

```

We collected occupancy data from `r jags_dat$tot.sites` fragments of potential habitat for *D. impar* across south-western Victoria, Australia between 2004 and 2013. Availability of a variety of landscape, habitat and disturbance related variables for these sites allowed us to test hypotheses concerning the influence of these factors in determining current occupancy, and probabilities of local extinction and colonisation within the study area. In turn, our long-term spatially-extensive dataset allows us to elucidate the relative contribution of habitat patch characteristics, disturbance regimes and spatial arrangement of habitat to occupancy dynamics of *D. impar*, and to identify management regimes needed to maintain occupancy of this threatened species.

# Methods

## Study area and sites

A total of `r jags_dat$tot.sites` sites were selected from the available extent of native grassland habitat across each of three Catchment Management Authority (CMA) areas in south-western Victoria: the Glenelg-Hopkins, Corangamite and Wimmera Catchment Management Authorities (Fig 1.).  The sites included both publicly and privately owned land and were subject to a range of land management practices. The sites included roadside and railway reserves, livestock grazing properties and formal conservation reserves. 

## Survey techniques

We established an array of 50 artificial cover objects (terra cotta roofing tiles) at each site. *D. impar* regularly shelters under natural surface objects such as exfoliated basalt rocks, and is also known to readily utilise artificial cover objects [@oshea2005thesis; @peterson2010communal; @howland2016habitat]. Tiles at each site were deployed in a regular grid pattern (5 by 10 tiles) spaced at 5 meter intervals. Tile grids were left in place for the duration of the study, with broken or missing tiles replaced as required.

Surveys involved visiting a site, and lifting each of the tiles in turn. All vertebrate species encountered beneath tiles were identified. Occasionally, evidence for the presence of *D. impar* was obtained from observations of sloughed skins underneath the tiles: where sloughed reptile skins could be identified with certainty they were treated as evidence of species presence. Sloughed skins were removed when detected, to avoid double-counting during subsequent surveys at the same site. A few cases of egg-laying beneath tiles were also recorded, and these were also taken as positive evidence of occurrence. At the time of each survey the following variables were also recorded: Julian date, time of day, air temperature and under-tile temperature. It was considered likely that each of these variables could influence the probability of detecting *D. impar* at sites where the species was present (see below). 

A total of `r jags_dat$tot.surveys` surveys were conducted at the `r jags_dat$tot.sites` survey sites between 2004 and 2013. Survey effort, both in the number of sites surveyed, and the number of surveys per site varied substantially between years, depending on resources available to conduct surveys (Table 1). In each year of monitoring between 65 and 281 sites were surveyed, with at least 217 sites being surveyed in all but the first and last years of the study. The mean number of surveys per site also varied substantially between years, from a minimum of 1.39 surveys per site in 2004/2005 to a maximum of 3.63 per site in 2007/2008 (Table 1).

## Landscape and management variables

As *D .impar* is a grassland specialist, we hypothesised that the amount of grassland habitat in the landscape surrounding each survey site would be positively correlated with the probability of initial occupancy. A GIS layer of predicted extent of native grassland in Victoria derived from floristic databases, expert knowledge, and statistical modelling of bioclimatic and remote-sensed variables was used to estimate the extent of native grassland within a 1000 m radius of each site.

Published accounts commonly refer to usage of soil cracks as shelter by *D. impar* [@oshea2005thesis], and associations between the presence of the *D. impar* and clay-rich soils with cracking characteristics are also reported [@dorrough1999]. We hypothesised that *D impar* would be more likely to occur at sites where the soil had higher clay-mineral content. As a surrogate for the availability of soil cracks at our sites, we obtained gridded GIS data on soil clay content, developed by the Australian Collaborative Land Evaluation Program (ACLEP), endorsed through the National Committee on Soil and Terrain (http://www.asris.csiro.au/themes/NationalGrids.html). 

Many currently extant populations of *D. impar* occur on roadside habitats. Roadsides in western Victoria are often uncultivated, frequently burnt to reduce wildfire risks, episodically grazed, and vegetated with remnant native grassland. In these regards, roadside habitats may at least partially mimic the prevailing vegetation and disturbance regimes that existed in the landscape prior to European settlement. We hypothesised that roadside habitat might be more likely to support populations of *D. impar* than other habitat types  such as grazing properties. 

We hypothesised that local extinction at our study sites could occur either as a consequence of stochastic demographic processes [as expected in small, isolated populations; @hanski1999metapopulation], or as a consequence of disturbance, habitat degradation or inappropriate management to which most sites (irrespective of size) are subject to varying degrees [@williams2007ela]. Abundances of the *D. impar* populations we studied are unknown, so we used an estimate of the area of surrounding suitable habitat (native grassland) as a surrogate for population size and hence a predictor of extinction risk due to demographic stochasticity [@hanski1999metapopulation].

We hypothesized that two disturbance processes- fire frequency and grazing intensity by livestock could be particularly important determinants of local extinction probabilities for this species, based either on existing knowledge of the lizard's biology [@howland2016habitat; @dorrough1999] or the effects of these variables on floristic and structural characteristics of native grasslands in south-eastern Australia [@howland2014eaten; @morgan1999effects]. We summarised the fire histories of each site based on the number of times each site was known to have been burnt between 2004 and 2013. Detailed historic fire histories were unavailable for most sites, so the extent to which current fire regimes are representative of historic fire regimes is unknown. Grazing intensity (mainly due to grazing by domestic sheep, and to a lesser extent Eastern Grey Kangaroos, *Macropus giganteus*) was categorised on a simple three-point ordinal scale from complete exclusion of grazing animals, through to intense, frequent grazing, based on observations by the authors and discussions with land managers. 

We had minimal prior knowledge regarding the occurrence of *D. impar* in areas surrounding each of the study sites, so the potential for colonisation from neighbouring occupied habitat was uncertain. We also had little knowledge of likely dispersal distances. In the absence of this information, we hypothesised that the predicted extent of native grassland habitat within a 1000 m radius surrounding each site would represent a useful surrogate for likely immigration rates and population connectivity, and hence be a useful predictor of colonisation probabilities.

## Statistical Analysis

### Patch occupancy model

A Bayesian state-space formulation [@royle2007bss; @roylebook] of the dynamic occupancy model with imperfect detectability [@mackenzie2002; @mackenzie2003] was used to model the processes of population extinction and colonisation amongst the study sites over the nine-year survey period. The model treats the occupancy state each site during year $t$ (denoted $\mathbf{Z}=z_{i,t}$) as imperfectly-observed and estimates the missing values based on an integrated model of the probabilities of populations persistence and colonisation and of detection conditional on presence. A state-space formulation was chosen as it explicitly infers the probabilities of occupancy of each site at each times step, conditional upon the observed data, the model and the priors (see below). Thus it is possible to use the model to make explicit probability statements about the occupancy states of either individual sites or aggregated inferences about the occupancy of groups of sites at any given time [@royle2007bss; @roylebook]. This last feature of the state-space model was particularly useful for inferring the trend in the number of occupied sites and the numbers of extinction and colonisation events in each year whilst propagating all modelled sources of uncertainty into the inferences [@royle2007bss].

At a given site $i$, and year $t$, the probability that the site is occupied is described by a Bernoulli process, with parameter $\psi_{i,t}$:

$$z_{i,t} \sim Bern(\psi_{i,t})$$

The process model for annual changes in the occupancy status of the sites can be described by the following equation [@royle2007bss; @martin2009pap]:

$$\psi_{i,t}= \phi_{i,t}\psi_{i,t-1}+\gamma_{i,t}(1-\psi_{i,t-1})$$

Where $\psi_{i,t}$ is the probability of occupancy at the $i^{th}$ site at time $t$, $\phi_{t}$ is the probability that the $i^{th}$ occupied site remains occupied between times $t$ and $t-1$, and $\gamma_{i,t}$ is the probability that the $i^{th}$ unoccupied site is colonised between times $t$ and $t-1$. 

Initial probability of occupancy at each study site $(\psi_{i,1})$ was modelled as a function of the extent of remaining native grassland habitat in the surrounding landscape, the mapped percentage of clay in the soil, and a binary variable indicating roadside habitat. Some survey grids were located in close proximity to each other, meaning that probabilities of occupancy could not reasonably be treated as independent at neighbouring sites. For the purposes of the analysis, sites located within 1000 m of each other were treated as belonging to a cluster, and normally distributed cluster-level random effects terms were included in the model to allow for dependence in the initial occupancy, persistence and colonisation probabilities among sites located in the same cluster.
 
$$\log \left(\dfrac{\psi_{i,1}}{1-\psi_{i,1}}\right)=\beta_{1}+\beta_{2}\text{grass}_{i}+\beta_{3}\text{clay}_{i}+\beta_{4}\text{roadside}_{i} +\epsilon_{\text{occ}}$$

We hypothesised that instances of local extinction at our study sites would occur either as a consequence of stochastic demographic processes relating to population size (for which surrounding native grassland extent was considered a useful surrogate) or as a consequence of prevailing fire and grazing regimes. Both linear and quadratic effect of fire and grazing were included in the model to allow for possible non-linearity in the effects of fire and grazing. Hence, the annual probability of population persistence, $\phi$ was modelled as:

$$
\begin{aligned}
\log \left(\dfrac{\phi_{i,t}}{1-\phi_{i,t}}\right)=\lambda_{1}+\lambda_{2}\text{grass}_{i}+\lambda_{3}\text{fire}_{i}+\lambda_{4}\text{fire}_{i}^{2}+\lambda_{5}\text{graze}_{i} + \lambda_{6}\text{graze}_{i}^{2}+\epsilon_{\text{persist}} 
\end{aligned}
$$

The annual probability of colonisation of vacant sites was modelled as being a function of the the predicted extent of native grassland habitat within a 1000 m radius, which as above, was an hypothesised surrogate for landscape connectivity for *D. impar* in the study area:

$$\log \left(\dfrac{\gamma_{i,t}}{1-\gamma_{i,t}}\right)=\delta_{1}+\delta_{2}\text{grass}_{i}+\epsilon_{\text{colonise}} $$   

### Observation model
For any given site, the probability of detecting *D. impar* during a single survey was described by a Bernoulli process  with parameter $p_{j}$, conditional on the site being occupied during the year of the survey $(z_{i,t}=1)$.  


$$y_{ijt} \sim Bern(p_{j}|z_{i,t}=1)$$

Spatial and temporal variation in the probability of detecting *D. impar* during surveys (conditional on presence) was modelled as a function of several survey-level covariates. Many detections during the course of the study were in the form of observations of sloughed skins (and in a very few cases eggs) underneath roof tiles, rather than observations of actual lizards. It was considered unlikely that detection of sloughed skins (or eggs) would be influenced by prevailing temperature or time of day, but deemed plausible that detection of sloughs would have a seasonal component which might differ from that applying to live animals. Accordingly, the detection model allowed for two distinct forms of detection, with different sets of covariates and differing seasonal patterns. In both cases, the annual seasonal trend in detection probability was modelled using a series of sine and cosine terms [a second-order Fourier series, @crespin2002sfb; @heard2015interspecific]. The influences of hour-of-day $(h)$ and under-tile temperatures $(T)$ on the probability of detection were modelled using both linear and quadratic terms to allow for possible curvature in the relationships between these variables and the probability of detection. We also hypothesised that lizards may be more likely to use tiles when temperatures below the tiles were warmer than the ambient temperature, but that this effect may be moderated at higher air temperatures. Therefore, we included the difference between the under-tile and air temperature $(\Delta T)$, and the interaction of this difference with the under-tile temperature as predictors of detection.

For actual lizards, the probability of detection $(p^{liz}_{j})$ was related to the survey-level covariates as follows:

$$
\begin{aligned}
\log \left(\dfrac{p^{liz}_{j}}{1-p^{liz}_{j}}\right) &=\alpha_{1}+ \\
& \phantom{p=} \alpha_{2}\cos2\pi \text{date}_{j}+ \alpha_{3}\sin2\pi \text{date}_{j}+\\
& \phantom{p=} \alpha_{4}\cos4\pi \text{date}_{j}+\alpha_{5}\sin4\pi \text{date}_{j}+ \\
& \phantom{p=} \alpha_{6}h_{j}+\alpha_{7}h_{j}^{2}+
                \alpha_{8}T_{j}+\alpha_{9}T_{j}^{2}+ \alpha_{10}\Delta T_{j}+ \alpha_{11}T_{j}\times\Delta T_{j}
\end{aligned}
$$

For sloughed skins and eggs, the probability of detection $(p^{indirect}_{j})$ was related to a single covariate (Julian date) as follows. 

$$
\begin{aligned}
\log \left(\dfrac{p^{indirect}_{j}}{1-p^{indirect}_{j}} \right) &=\alpha_{12}+ \\
& \phantom{p=} \alpha_{13}\cos2\pi \text{date}_{j}+\alpha_{14}\sin2\pi \text{date}_{j}+ \\
& \phantom{p=} \alpha_{15}\cos4\pi \text{date}_{j}+\alpha_{16}\sin4\pi \text{date}_{j}
\end{aligned}
$$

Prior to analysis, Julian dates were transformed to the interval $[0,1]$, times of day (measured in hours) were centred around midday, and under-tile temperatures were centred around the mean value of $22^{\circ}\text{C}$.

Assuming that the two methods of detection were independent of each other, we calculated the overall probability of detection $(p^{total})$ when both methods of detection are applied under the same survey conditions (date, time, temperature etc.) as follows:

$$
p^{total}=1-\left((1-p^{indirect})(1-p^{liz})\right)
$$
In order to summarize the changes in occupancy across all `r jags_dat$tot.sites` sites over the course of the study, we also inferred the number of occupied sites at each time step [$N_{t}$ see,@royle2007bss] from the latent occupancy states ($\mathbf{Z}$) of the state-space model as follows:

$$
N_{t}=\sum \limits_{i=1}^{i=k} z_{i,t}
$$

Similarly, the number of colonisation ($\text{col}_{t}$) and extinction ($\text{ext}_{t}$) events, and the net change in occupancy ($\Delta N_{t}$) at each time-step was calculated as follows:

$$
\begin{aligned}
\text{col}_{t}&=\sum \limits_{i=1}^{i=k} \left(z_{i,t}=1|z_{i,t-1}=0 \right)\\
\text{ext}_{t}&=\sum \limits_{i=1}^{i=k} \left(z_{i,t}=0|z_{i,t-1}=1 \right)\\
\Delta N_{t}&=\text{col}_{t}- \text{ext}_{t}
\end{aligned}
$$

### Fitting the model

The full, integrated model of occupancy, persistence, colonisation and detection was fitted to the data using Bayesian Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods. Fitting of the model was carried out using JAGS version 4.1.0 [@plummer2003jags]. Convergence of the MCMC algorithm was assessed using the Brooks-Gelman-Rubin statistic [@BGR] and by visual inspection of the chain-histories of selected parameters. A burn-in period of `r format(n.burnin, big.mark=",")` iterations of the MCMC algorithm was used to ensure convergence. An additional `r format(n.iter, big.mark=",")` iterations were then generated from each of `r format(n.chains, big.mark=",")` chains, retaining every `r format(n.thin, big.mark=",")`$^{th}$ iteration for inferences regarding the joint posterior distribution of the parameters and related derived quantities such as the expected numbers of occupied sites, number of colonisations and number of extinctions at each time-step (see above). Following @gelman2006prior and @gelman2008weakly, vaguely informative Cauchy(0, 2.5) priors were specified for the regression parameters of the model, and half-Cauchy(0, 25) priors were specified for the standard deviations of the cluster-level random effects. JAGS code used to fit the model is provided in the Appendix.

The observed (naive) prevalence  of *D. impar* at the sites actually sampled in each year averaged `r format(100*mean(colSums(z.init, na.rm=TRUE))/291, digits=2)`%, fluctuating between `r format(100*min(colSums(z.init, na.rm=TRUE))/291, digits=2)`% and `r format(100*max(colSums(z.init, na.rm=TRUE))/291, digits=2)`%. *D. impar* was detected at least once at `r colSums(z.init, na.rm=TRUE)[1]` of the `r tapply(jags_dat$site, jags_dat$t, function(x) length(unique(x)))[1]` sites surveyed in the first year of this study (Fig. 2), an observed prevalence of `r format(100*colSums(z.init, na.rm=TRUE)[1]/291, digits=3)`% (Fig. 2). 

The probability of site occupancy in the first year ($\psi_{1}$) was positively associated with the extent of modelled native grassland within a 1000 m radius of the sites, the proportion of clay in the soil and with roadside habitat type (Fig. 3).

The annual probability of population persistence, ($\phi_{t}$) was most strongly correlated with grazing and fire frequency (Fig. 3). Both high frequencies of fire, and high intensities of grazing resulted in greater probabilities of persistence than regimes where fire and grazing were excluded (Fig. 3). The extent of native grassland in the surrounding landscape had little effect on annual probability of persistence (Fig. 3). 

The annual probability of colonisation of unoccupied sites ($\gamma_{t}$) was strongly and positively correlated with grassland area in the surrounding (1000 m radius) landscape. (Fig. 3.)

With extinctions outstripping colonisations, the predicted number of occupied sites declined over the course of the study from `r format(startocc[1], digits=3)` (95\% CI: `r format(startocc[3], digits=4)`, `r format(startocc[4], digits=4)`) in the first year of the study, to `r format(endocc[1], digits=3)` sites (95\% CI: `r format(endocc[3], digits=4)`, `r format(endocc[4], digits=4)`) in the final year of the study (an overall loss  of `r format(decline[1], digits=3)` (95\% CI: `r format(decline[3], digits=4)`, `r format(decline[4], digits=4)`) occupied sites over the 9 years of monitoring; Fig. 2). The net change in occupancy varied among years (and had high uncertainty, Fig. 4), but averaged a loss of `r format(-annchange[1], digits=2)` (95\% CI `r format(-annchange[4], digits=2)`, `r format(-annchange[3], digits=4)`) sites per annum.

The cluster-level random effects terms associated with probabilities of colonisation were especially small, and had little uncertainty. Cluster-level variation in the random effects on the probabilities of initial occupancy was greater than than the equivalent random effects terms associated with persistence and colonisation, but was also more uncertain (Fig 4). 

## Detection

Probabilities of detection by observation of lizards and by indirect evidence such as sloughed skins and eggs displayed clear but contrasting annual seasonal cycles (Fig. 5). For lizards, there was a distinct peak in detection probability between September and November (i.e. the Austral spring), with progressively lower detection probabilities from December through to August. Detection probabilities of sloughed skins and eggs were highest in mid-Summer (December--January), dropping to very low levels between Winter and early Spring (June--September, Fig. 5). Combined, the probabilities of detection for *D. impar* by any method peaked during Spring, and progressively decreased through Summer and Autumn, before reaching a minimum during the Winter months (Fig. 5).

Under-tile temperatures also affected the probability of detecting lizards, independent of the underlying seasonal effects. Probabilities of detection were highest when tile temperatures were greater than air temperatures, particularly when air temperatures were less than 25 $^\circ \text{C}$. When tile temperatures exceeded 35 - 40 $^\circ \text{C}$, detection became less likely, regardless of air temperature(Table 2, Fig. 5).

# Discussion

Over the course of the study, the proportion of our sites occupied by *D. impar* declined.  Declines were most marked during the first year of the study, a period coinciding with a prolonged and severe drought in south-eastern Australia [@dijk2013millennium]. The rate of local extinctions outstripped the rate at which vacant habitat was colonised. If the observed rates of decline at the study sites are consistent with broader trends in occupancy of remnant habitat across the species' range, then a continuing decline in the conservation status of *D. impar* is to be expected. 

Initially, site occupancy $(\psi_{1})$ for *D. impar* was positively associated with the extent of native grassland in the surrounding landscape, the proportion of clay minerals in the soil, and were higher on roadside habitats. These findings are all consistent with our initial hypotheses about the effects of these variables on occupancy of *D. impar*. Previous studies have documented the close association of *D. impar* with native grassland habitats [@recoveryplan; @oshea2005thesis; @howland2016habitat], so the positive relationship between occupancy by *D. impar* and high landscape coverage of native grassland is unsurprising. Similarly, the use of soil crack refuges by *D. impar* is well documented [@recoveryplan; @oshea2005thesis; @dorrough1999], so a positive association with clay-rich soils, prone to cracking is to be expected. The positive association between probability of initial occupancy and roadside habitat type is also consistent with previous occurrence records for *D. impar* in Western Victoria, many of which are from roadside reserves. Subsequent to European settlement, roadside reserves often retained their native grassland vegetation, and were also less likely to be subjected to agricultural practices such as cultivation and application of fertilizers. A long history of deliberate burning and episodic grazing is also a feature of roadside habitats in Western Victoria, which may historically have helped to maintain native grassland on these sites, and thereby maintained their suitability for occupancy by *D. impar* within a wider matrix of more intensively and unsuitably managed cropland and improved pasture.

Although rates of occupancy declined overall, inferred probabilities of persistence ($\phi$) were not homogeneous among sites, and were both associated with habitat and management features at the landscape and site levels. Across the study area, rates of persistence were found to be higher at sites that were subjected to episodic burning and grazing by domestic livestock. While the underlying ecological mechanisms for these relationships require further study, the observed associations between grazing, fire and persistence of *D. impar* populations may have resulted from reduced levels of dominance by invasive plants in appropriately grazed and/or burnt grassland, and reduced pasture biomass. Excessive pasture biomass may be detrimental to *D. impar* due to shading effects on thermoregulatory behaviour, or because thick accumulations of plant biomass limits access to preferred microhabitats such as soil cracks [@howland2014eaten; @howland2016habitat]. Yearly probabilities of persistence showed little relationship with the amount of grassland habitat present in the landscapes surrounding the sites, possibly reflecting the ability of *D. impar* to persist in small grassland remnants, and to utilise other habitat types such as pasture and degraded grasslands provided that structural features and disturbance regimes of these habitat are appropriate.

Our finding that probabilities of persistence are higher in the presence of both grazing and burning points to the possibility of using these actions either alone or in combination as a management tools to reduce the rate at which local populations of *D. impar* go extinct. Our results show that applying appropriate fire and grazing regimes can effectively increase the probability that local populations of *D. impar* persist in grassland remnants. In order to make more definite conclusions about the effect of fire and grazing regimes, more precise and detailed data are necessary. For fire, this would include information on the frequency, seasonal timing, spatial extent and intensity of burning.  

Prior to European colonisation, the native grasslands of south-eastern Australia were subject to grazing by native herbivores (mainly Eastern Grey Kangaroos, *Macropus giganteus* and other macropods) and to fire, either caused by lightning strikes, or deliberately lit by indigenous people [@edney1990late; @crowley1994late]. Both fire and grazing play a prominent role in structuring native grassland ecosystems in south-eastern Australia [@morgan1999defining; @morgan1999effects; @edney1990late; @crowley1994late]. European colonists largely replaced native grazing animals with domestic sheep and invasive European rabbits (*Oryctolagus cuniculus*), made extensive use of artificial fertilizers, converted native grasslands to exotic pastures and cropland and altered fire regimes. Non-productive parts of the landscape, such as roadsides and rail reserves, continue to be frequently burnt to reduce biomass and hence fuel load as a wildfire mitigation strategy [@lunt2002grasslands]. The widespread persistence of *D. impar* on roadside habitats may well stem in part from the partial maintenance of pre-European fire regimes as well as the less extensive modification and degradation of native grasslands in these parts of the landscape. 

Our results show that probabilities of colonisation ($\gamma$) of vacant habitat by *D. impar* are chiefly governed by availability of remnant grassland habitat in close proximity to the sites. The probability of colonisation at our study sites was strongly and positively influenced by the extent of mapped native grassland habitat in the surrounding landscape. While little is know about movement patterns and home range sizes of *D. impar*, there is some evidence that it is a sedentary species [@coulson1990conservation; @kutt1992microhabitat; @dorrough1999]. While movements of up to 60 m have been recorded during the mating period [@kutt1992microhabitat; @kukolic1994survey], recapture data suggests very small home ranges are typical (<10 m^2^) [@oshea2005thesis]. Genetic evidence is also suggestive of very limited dispersal distances [@maldonado2012human]. It seems that movements between habitat patches separated by more than a few hundred meters of unsuitable matrix are unlikely, which will severely limit the capacity for *D. impar* to recolonise isolated, vacant areas of otherwise suitable habitat.

Our findings that habitat management influences persistence, and habitat fragmentation influences colonisation have clear conservation and management implications for *D. impar*. The apparent association between disturbance regimes and probabilities of persistence allows some initial direction in selecting management regimes that could be expanded across the species geographic range in order to maintain and improve rates of occupancy. The finding that persistence is more likely at sites that are burnt or grazed suggests that wider and more consistent application of these management actions would be beneficial for this species. An important question for future research on the management of *D. impar* is to identify the most appropriate fire and grazing regimes. Our finding  that fire and grazing are positively associated with persistence of *D. impar* needs to be applied cautiously by managers: it is likely that grazing or fire applied too often, too intensely or with incorrect seasonal timing would have a negative effects on the persistence of *D. impar* populations. The relatively simple metrics we have used here to quantify fire and grazing regimes at our sites may not be suitable for detecting relationships between these aspect of fire and grazing regimes and occupancy by *D. impar*. An experimental approach to fire and grazing management is therefore required: sites known to be occupied by *D. impar* could be experimentally subjected to a variety of fire and grazing regimes, and the resulting patterns of persistence would allow superior management regimes to be identified over time. The relationships between fire and grazing and persistence by *D. impar* revealed by our analysis showed little evidence of curvature, with estimated rates of persistence near the upper end of the observed ranges no less than those observed at more moderate levels of grazing and fire (Fig. 4). However, the uncertainty around these fitted curves is quite large, meaning that it is not reasonable to conclude that management of fire and grazing to the very highest levels of intensity is necessarily the most desirable option.

The effect of fragmentation on rates of colonisation presents a more difficult challenge to managers. Opportunities to decrease current levels of isolation between patches of remnant habitat by extensive habitat restoration are likely to be severely limited across much of the species' range. Economically important land-uses such as broadacre cropping, livestock grazing (particularly where pasture improvement and fertilizer application has taken place) and urban development have lead to large areas of unsuitable habitat across the species' range, which are for the most part not compatible with management efforts to enhance connectivity between isolated habitat patches by ecosystem restoration. Land-use changes that further reduce connectivity between known areas of suitable habitat should be prevented wherever possible to prevent further erosion of opportunities for colonisation between areas of remnant native grassland. While restoration of destroyed or degraded native grassland may have some limited capacity to restore functional connectivity between isolated population of *D. impar*, it is unlikely that widespread restoration of degraded or destroyed grassland habitat can be used to significantly improve connectivity between currently isolated habitat remnants across large parts of the species' range.

For some isolated and unoccupied habitat remnants, the technical feasibility of reintroducing *D. impar* could be explored. Such efforts should be restricted to areas of high quality, well-managed habitat where persistence of established populations is more likely in the long term. In particular, ensuring that appropriate disturbance regimes are applied may prove essential for maintaining newly established populations. As our model allows the prediction of probabilities of persistence from habitat and management variables, it could be used to prioritise sites for reintroduction based on their estimated probabilities of persistence.  Introduction of *D. impar* to fragments which are small in size, isolated, of low habitat quality, or where favourable management regimes cannot be sustained is unlikely to be successful. The feasibility of translocation as a method for establishing new populations of *D. impar* is currently unknown, and would require experimental evaluation to determine it's value as a conservation strategy. For ensuring conservation outcomes for the species as a whole, investment in retention and appropriate management of currently occupied habitat is likely to be much more cost-effective than investment in reintroduction actions, given the high costs, and generally low success rates of reintroduction programs for threatened reptiles [@germano2009suitability; @dodd1991relocation].

Analysis of the artificial cover object detection data presented here leads to some important conclusions regarding appropriate methods for survey and monitoring of *D. impar*. Probability of detection has a strong seasonal variability, with detection maximised during late spring and early summer. Detection probabilities during the winter months are particularly low, meaning that surveys conducted during these months are unlikely to provide useful information on occupancy by *D. impar*. Our finding that *D. impar* are more likely to be found beneath tiles at intermediate temperatures, and when under-tile temperatures are warmer than ambient, could be used to target surveys to times with appropriate meteorological conditions, so as to maximise probabilities of detection. 

Our results show the value of combining long-term and spatially extensive data with dynamic modelling approaches for understanding the drivers of occupancy dynamics of species inhabiting fragmented landscapes. At the outset of our study occupancy of *D. impar* was positively associated with soil clay content, landscape-scale grassland availability and roadside habitat-type. Subsequently, annual persistence was mainly determined by disturbance processes, but was largely independent of grassland availability in the landscape. Colonisation of vacant habitat was limited by availability of grassland habitat in the surrounding landscape, consistent with a dispersal-limited model of colonisation. 

Collectively, these findings provide clear guidance to managers seeking to arrest the decline of *D. impar*. Local extinctions are most likely to occur where fire and grazing are excluded, regardless of fragment size. For populations of *D. impar* occurring in landscapes with low proportional cover of native grassland, such local extinction are much more likely to be permanent as insufficient sources of immigrants will exist within dispersal range to allow for recolonisation. Wherever possible, managers should seek to apply at least moderate intensities of fire or grazing to *D. impar* habitats, in order to prevent local extinctions.
