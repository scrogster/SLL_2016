# Introduction

For species inhabiting recently fragmented landscapes, persistence depends on the viability of populations within retained habitat fragments, together with adequate capacity for recolonisation of vacant habitat to compensate for stochastic or deterministic local extinctions. Long-term viability requires that rates at which vacant sites are recolonised adequately offsets rates of extinction, otherwise ongoing decline in occupancy rates will ensue, ultimately resulting in landscape scale extinction. Cost-efficient conservation of species inhabiting fragmented landscapes involves identifying and implementing management actions that maximise overall, landscape-scale probability of persistence, by enhancing probabilities of persistence and/or colonisation at the individual patch level.

Dynamics of species occupancy within recntly fragmented landscapes reflect the collective results of several inter-related ecological processes. Firstly, historical patterns of occupancy in the previously unfragmented landscape provide limits on the extent of initial occupancy. Secondy, consequent to fragmentation, deterministic loss of initially occupied habitat occurs, as habitat is either removed or severely degraded. Populations occupying remaining habitat fragments will then experience varying probabilities of persistence, as a consequence of variation in the size and quality of the fragments of habitat they occupy. Finally, differential rates of migration into fragments, as a consequence of variation in distances to other occupied fragments, their size and qualities, and the permeability of the matrix to dispersal determine the extent to which vacant habitat can be colonised, and fragmented populations reinforced by immigration. In the absence of data on pre-fragmentation habitat quality and and occupancy by a focal species, it is often difficult to determine the relative importance of each of these four processes in determining present patterns of occupancy,  let alone to predict likely future trends or likely responses to management. 

Both theoretical [@tilman1994habitat; @hanski2002extinction; @kuussaari2009extinction] and observational [@helm2006slow; @gu2002estimating; @sang2010indirect; @van2011metapopulation] evidence suggest that in fragmented landscapes, there may be a significant delay in extinction processes subsequent to fragmentation, possibly lasting decades or centuries (an extinction debt), meaning that snapshot studies of occupancy within fragmented landscapes may result in underestimation of the ultimate impact of fragmentation on species, or a misplaced emphasis on the effects of habitat quantity and quality as mechanisms driving present occupancy, rather than fragmentation and isolation of habitat [@tilman1994habitat; @hanski2002extinction].

By tracking patterns of extinction and colonisation amongst habitat fragments varying in size, quality and connectivity, insight into the processes leading to extinction and colonisation over time can be derived from successive sets of occupancy data [@heard2012classical; @frey2012relative]. In particular, correlative approaches can be used to determine how initial occupancy states, colonisation and extinction processes are driven by habitat extent, quality and connectivity.

Investigations of the spatial dynamics of habitat-specialist species inhabiting recently fragmented landscapes are well suited to studies that seek to resolve the relative contribution of these processes to determining current occupancy. The Striped Legless Lizard (*Delma impar*) occurs primarily within areas of native grasslands on the south eastern Australian mainland, although occurences have been recorded in other vegetation types, including degraded grasslands, grassy woodlands and modified pastures [@dorrough1999; @gemmathesis]. Native grassland was widespread in southeastern Australia at the time of European settlement (c. 180 yr BP), but has been systematically destroyed and degraded through livestock grazing, cultivation, introduction of exotic plant species and urban development. Only a small fraction of the original extent remains, chiefly in the form of small, isolated remnants, most of which are not located in formal conservation reserves, or otherwise intentionally managed for conservation. Remnant native grassland continues to be degraded through weed invasion and inappropriate fire, grazing and cultivation regimes. Legal and illegal destruction of remnant grassland also continues, in spite of widespread recognition of the poor conservation status of this vegetation type and it's distinctive biota, and well-established legislative and regulatory frameworks for  protection of remnants [@williams2005fil; @williams2005pta;  @williams2007ela].

The extent of historic destruction and degradation of what was once an essentially a vast contiguous tract of habitat extending across a large portion of southeastern Australia has lead *D. impar* and other grassland-specialist flora and fauna to undergo profound reductions in extent of occurrence [@maldonado2012human]. While it is well established that populations of *D. impar* remain within fragments of remnant habitat across its current historic range, it is not known with certainty whether the species is continuing to decline through ongoing localised extinction of isolated, remnant populations. Furthermore, although it has been hypothesised that inappropriate management and degradation of habitat may adversely effect populations of *D. impar*, formal, quantitative assessment of the habitat and management requirements for ensuring population persistence have not been conducted. Similarly, the extent to which any current (as opposed to historic) declines can be attributed to the size, quality and management of habitat patches, or to population isolation and barriers to migration between habitat patches is unknown. Hence, it is difficult to determine how best to prioritise possible management actions so as to maximise the resulting conservation benefits. 

We collected occupancy data from a large number of fragments (~300) of likely habitat for *D. impar* across south-western Victoria over the course of 10 years. Artificial cover objects were used to detect the presence of *D. impar* at the sites, and over time, extinction and colonisation events were inferred from the data using dynamic occupancy models, while allowing for imperfect detection of this cryptic species [@mackenzie2003; @royle2007bss]. Availability of a variety of landscape, habitat and management variables for the sites allowed us to  to test  hypotheses concerning the influence of these factors in determining current occupancy, and probabilities of local extinction and colonisation within the study area. 

# Methods

## Field data collection

```{r, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE}
load("fitted_model.Rdata")

```


A total of `r jags_dat$tot.sites`  sites were selected from the available range of native grassland habitat available across each of three catchment management authority (CMA) areas located in western and central Victoria, Australia. Sites included both publicly and privately owned land, and were subject to a range of land management practices. *Garry, please write a couple of sentences here about how the sites were selected*.  At each site 50 artificial cover objects (ceramic roofing tiles) were deployed in a grid pattern (5 tiles by 10 tiles) spaced at 5 meter intervals. A single site was established in 2003, with monitoring of most of the remaining sites being established during 2004. A few additional sites were added to the study in each subsequent years as time and resources allowed. Most sites were surveyed at least once in every year, while many sites were surveyed multiple times each year. Surveys involved visiting the sites, and lifting each of the 50 tiles in turn. All vertebrate species (mainly reptiles and frogs, but also small mammals such as Dunnarts (*Sminthopsis* spp.), were captured, identified and immediately released. Occasionally, evidence for the presence of reptiles was obtained from observations of sloughed skins underneath the tiles- where these skins could be identified with certainty they were treated as positive evidence of occupancy. At the time of each survey the following variables that were thought likely to influence detection probability were recorded: Julian date, time of day, air temperature, under-tile soil temperature and time of day. It was considered likely that these variables could influence the probability of detecting *Delma impar* during surveys at site where the species was present. This hypothesis was explored as part of the statistical analysis of the survey data.

## Landscape and management variables

A GIS layer of predicted extent of native grassland in Victoria, derived from floristic databases, expert knowledge, and statistical modelling of bioclimatic and remote-sensed variables (reference to DELWP model) was used to estimate the extent of native grassland within various radii of each monitoring site to provide an estimate of currently available grassland habitat in the vicinity of each site.

Detailed data on the history, intensity and frequency of livestock (mainly sheep) grazing at the study sites was unavailable. As an imperfect surrogate for this information, sites were simply classified as grazed or ungrazed, based on observations during the surveys. Similarly, detailed fire history for many of the sites was lacking. We classified the recent fire histories of each sites into three categories: unburnt, burnt once and burnt more than once during the study period. More detailed, historic fire histories were unavailable for most sites. Sites were classified as being managed for conservation if they were located on a formal conservation reserve, or if land managers otherwise reported that the site was managed either partially or wholly for the conservation of *D impar* or other grassland biota.

## Statistical Analysis

### Process model


A Bayesian state-space formulation [@royle2007bss; @roylebook] of the dynamic occupancy model with imperfect detectability [@mackenzie2002; @mackenzie2003] was used to model the ongoing processes of extinction and colonisation that lead to the observed pattern of occupancy amongst the study sites over the course of the the period of observation. The model treats the occupancy states of the sites during each year (denoted **Z**) as a partially-observed latent variable, and infers the values of the unknown elements of the time/occupancy matrix based on the detection histories, and the extinction and colonisation parameters. The Bayesian state-space formulation was chosen as the Bayesian state-space model explicitly infers the probabilities of occupancy of each site at each times step, conditional upon the observed data, the model and the priors. Thus it is possible to make explicit probability statements about the occupancy states of either individual sites, or aggregated inferences about the occupancy of groups of sites at any given time [@royle2007bss; @roylebook]. This last feature of the model was of particular utility for inferring the trend in the number of occupied sites, and the numbers of extinction and colonisation events in each year, whilst correctly propagating all modelled sources of uncertainty into the inferences.

$$z_{i,t} \sim Bern(\psi_{i,t})$$

The process model for temporal changes in the occupancy status of the sites can be described by the equation [@martin2009pap]:

$$\psi_{i,t}= \phi_{i,t}\psi_{i,t-1}+\gamma_{i,t}(1-\psi_{i,t-1})$$

Where $\psi_{i,t}$ is the probability of occupancy at the $i^{th}$ site at time $t$, $\phi_{t}$ is the probability that the $i^{th}$ occupied site remains occupied between times $t$ and $t-1$, and $\gamma_{i,t}$ is the probability that the $i^{th}$ unoccupied site is recolonised between times $t$ and $t-1$.

Initial occupancies $(\psi_{i,1})$ for each site were modelled as depending on a combination of the extent of remaining grassland habitat in the surrounding landscape, whether the site was currently managed for conservation, and whether the site was subject to livestock grazing. The relationship between these three variables, and the probability of current occupancy was described using a logistic regression model:
$$\log \left(\dfrac{\psi_{i,1}}{1-\psi_{i,1}}\right)=\beta_{1}+\beta_{2}grass_{i}+\beta_{3}conserv_{i}+\beta_{4}graze_{i} $$

We hypothesised that instances of local extinction at any of our study sites would occur either as a consequence of stochastic demographic processes (as expected in small, isolated populations [@hanski1994pmm]), or as a consequence of disturbance, habitat degradation or inappropriate management, to which most sites (irrespective of size) are subject to a varying degree. Population sizes (absolute abundance) for the *Delma impar* populations we studied are unknown, so we used an estimate of the area of suitable habitat (native grassland) available within the vicinity of each site as a surrogate for the likely maximum population size, and hence a predictor of rates of stochastic extinction [@hanski1994pmm]. Additional landscape, habitat and management variables were also considered as probable influences on the local extinction probabilities. These habitat/management variables were:  fire frequency, grazing regime and management for conservation:

$$
\begin{aligned}
\log \left(\dfrac{\phi_{i,t}}{1-\phi_{i,t}}\right)=\lambda_{1}+\lambda_{2}grass_{i}+\lambda_{3}fire_{i}+\lambda_{4}graze_{i}+\lambda_{5}conserv_{i}
\end{aligned}
$$

Most of the sites known to be occupied by *Delma impar* are essentially isolated from potential sources of immigration by large areas of unsuitable, modified habitats such as cultivated and grazed farmland and assumed barriers such as roads. Hence, recolonisation of sites which undergo local extinction is considered unlikely in most cases. We had minimal knowledge regarding the occurence of *D. impar* in areas close to each of the study sites,
so the potential for recolonisation from neighbouring habitat patches was essentially unknown. The predicted extent of native grassland habitat (insert citation to Matt's model) within a 10 ha circle surrounding each monitoring plot was included in the model as a measure of the extent of neighbouring habitat. It was hypothesised that the occurence of large areas of suitable habitat in the vicinity of each monitoring site would increase the probability of recolonisation in the event of local extinction, due to the potential for recolonisation from adjacent areas of occupied habitat. This effect was modelled by relating the probability of recolonisation, $\gamma$ to the area of nearby native grassland habitat using a linear equation and logit link.

$$\log \left(\dfrac{\gamma_{i,t}}{1-\gamma_{i,t}}\right)=\delta_{1}+\delta_{2}grass_{i} $$              

### Observation model

$$y_{ijt} \sim Bern(p_{j}|z_{i,t}=1)$$

Spatial and temporal heterogeneity in the probability of detecting *D. impar* during surveys (conditional on presence) was modelled by relating the probability of detection, $p$, to one or more covariates using a linear equation and logistic link function. A proportion of detections during the course of the study were in the form of observations of sloughed skins underneath roof tiles, rather than observations of actual lizards. It was considered unlikely that detection of sloughs would be influenced by prevailing temperature or time of day, but plausible that detection of sloughs would have a seasonal component which might differ from that for actual lizards. Accordingly, the detection model allowed for two distinct forms of detection, with different sets of covariates and differing seasonal patterns for lizards and for sloughs. In both cases, the annual seasonal trend in detection probability was modelled using a series of sine and cosine terms (a second-order Fourier series, [@crespin2002sfb; @heard2015interspecific]). The influences of time-of-day $(t)$; and soil (under tile) temperatures $(T)$ on the probability of detection were modelled using both linear quadratic terms, to allow for possible
curvature in the relationships between these variables and the probability of detection.

For actual lizards, the probability of detection $(p^{liz}_{j})$ was related to the survey-level covariates as follows:

$$
\begin{aligned}
\log \left(\dfrac{p^{liz}_{j}}{1-p^{liz}_{j}}\right) &=\alpha_{1}+ \\
& \phantom{p=} \alpha_{2}\cos2\pi date_{j}+ \alpha_{3}\sin2\pi date_{j}+\\
& \phantom{p=} \alpha_{4}\cos4\pi date_{j}+\alpha_{5}\sin4\pi date_{j}+ \\
& \phantom{p=} \alpha_{6}t_{j}+\alpha_{7}t_{j}^{2}+
                \alpha_{8}T_{j}+\alpha_{9}T_{j}^{2}
\end{aligned}
$$

For sloughed skins, the probability of detection $(p^{skin}_{j})$ was related to the single covariate (Julian date) as follows. 

$$
\begin{aligned}
\log \left(\dfrac{p^{skin}_{j}}{1-p^{skin}_{j}} \right) &=\alpha_{10}+ \\
& \phantom{p=} \alpha_{11}\cos2\pi date_{j}+\alpha_{12}\sin2\pi date_{j}+ \\
& \phantom{p=} \alpha_{13}\cos4\pi date_{j}+\alpha_{14}\sin4\pi date_{j}
\end{aligned}
$$

Prior to analysis, Julian dates were tranformed to the interval $[0,1]$, times of day (measured in hours) were centered around midday, and temperatures were centered around the approximate mean value of $22^{\circ}\text{C}$.

Assuming that the two methods of detection were independent of each other, we calculated the overall probability of detection $(p^{total})$ when both methods of detection are applied under the same survey conditions (date, time, temperature etc.) as follows:

$$
p^{total}=1-\left((1-p^{skin})(1-p^{liz})\right)
$$

### Fitting the model

The full, integrated model including both the ecological processes (intial occupancy, colonisation and extinction) and observation (detectability) components was estimated from the data using Bayesian Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods. Fitting of the model was carried out using Just Another Gibbs Sampler [@plummer2003jags]. Convergence of the MCMC algorithm was assessed using the Brooks-Gelman-Rubin statistic [@BGR], and by visual inspection of the chain-histories of selected parameters. Empirically, it was found that an initial burn-in period of approximately 500 iterations of the MCMC algorithm was required to ensure convergence. An additional 2,000 iterations after the burn-in were retained for inferences regarding the joint posterior distribution of the parameters, and related derived quantities such as the expected numbers of occupied sites, number of colonisations and number of extinctions at each time-step. Vague (uninformative) priors were specified for the parameters of the model. Priors were also specified for missing values in the data, which mainly occurred when the times of surveys were not recorded during site visits, or where ambient and soil (under-tile) temperatures were not measured. Priors for these missing covariate values were mildly informative, being based on the observed distribution of values for the covariates at the sites where they were observed, and understanding of the plausibility of various values for these quantities (See JAGS code in appendix for details).

# Results

Over the course of the study, a total of 4676 surveys were conducted at the 295 survey sites. Survey effort, both in the number of sites surveyed, and the number of surveys per site varied substantially between years, depending on resources available to conduct surveys (Table 1). In each year of monitoring between 65 and 281 sites were surveyed, with at least 217 sites being surveyed in all but the first and last years of the study. The mean number of surveys per site also varied substantially between years, from a minimum of 1.39 surveys per site, to a maximum of 3.63 per site (Table 1). The proportion of surveyed sites that recorded at least one detection of *D. impar* was less than 18.1\% in all but the final year of survey, when 35.4\% of surveyed sites yielded detections of *D. impar*, possibly reflecting preferential sampling of known-occupied sites in the final year of the study.

The state-space analysis of occupancy revealed a decline in the number of occupied sites over the course of the study. At the outset of the study, the state-space model predicted that `r format(startocc[1], digits=3)` (95\% CI `r format(startocc[3], digits=4)`, `r format(startocc[4], digits=4)`) sites were occupied. This declined to `r format(endocc[1], digits=3)` sites (95\% CI `r format(endocc[3], digits=4)`, `r format(endocc[4], digits=4)`) in the final year of the study-- an overall loss  of `r format(decline[1], digits=3)` (95\% CI `r format(decline[3], digits=4)`, `r format(decline[4], digits=4)`) occupied sites over the 9 years of monitoring (Fig. 2). Importantly, the numbers of occupied sites estimated from the state-space model always exceeded the number of sites at which *D. impar* was actually detected during monitoring, highlighting the imperfect and variable detectability of this species.

The observed decline in occupancy was a consequence of the overall rate of population extinctions outstripping the rate at which vacant sites were colonised (Figs. 3-4). The net change in occupancy varied among years, and had moderately high uncertainty (Fig. 4), but was indicative of an annual loss in the number of occupied sites of `r format(-annchange[1], digits=3)`(95\% CI `r format(-annchange[3], digits=4)`,`r format(-annchange[4], digits=4)`) per year.

Occupancy of the study sites at the commencement of the study $(\psi_{1})$ was strongly correlated with the extent of modelled native grassland coverage within a 1000 m radius of the sites (Fig. 5). Management variables (grazing regime and conservation landuse) had a much smaller effect, with some weak evidence that grazing land use led to a greater probability of initial occupancy, and conservation land use led to a lesser probability of initial occupancy (Fig. 5).

Subsequently to the first year of the study, the probability that currently occupied sites remain occupied (probability of persistence, $\phi$) was found to be most strongly dependent on the the presence of grazing and fire (Fig. 6). The extent of grassland in the surrounding landscape, and conservation management both had only weak effects on persistence (Fig. 6). The effect of surrounding grassland was very uncertain. 

The probability that unoccupied sites would be colonised during the study was found to be strongly positively associated with the presence of extensive grassland area in the landscape surrounding the site. (Fig. 7.)

Probabilities of detection for both lizards and sloughed skins displayed strong but contrasting seasonal trends (Fig. 8). For detection of lizards, there was a distinct peak in detection probability during the Austral Spring (September - November), with progressively lower detection probabilities through Summer, Autumn and Winter (December - August). Detection probabilities of sloughed skins were highest in mid-summer, only dropping to very low levels during late Winter and early Spring (Fig. 8.). When detection probabilities under the two methods were combined to yield a single probability of detection(see Methods), probabilities of detecting *D impar* at occupied sites were highest during Spring, and progressively decreased through the Summer and Autum, before reaching a minimum during the Winter months (Figure 8).

After accounting for the seasonal trend in detection proabilities of lizards, there was little evidence for effects of either time of day, or under-tile soil temperatures on the probability of detection. All regression parameters for these effects included zero within their 95\% credible intervals (Table 2).

# Discussion

*Discussion is a bit disordered at present, so feel free to rewrite, reorganise or add other ideas to the mix*

Our analysis has revealed that over the course of the study, the proportion of study sites occupied by *D. impar* has undergone a slow, but steady decline.  The rate of local extinctions outstripped the rate at which unoccpied sites can be colonised. If the observed rates of decline at the study sites are consistent with broader trends in occupancy of remnant habitat across the species' range, then continuing decline in the conservation status of *D. impar* is to be expected.

Although rates of occupancy were observed to decline overall, inferred probabilities of colonisation and extinction were not homogenous among sites, and were strongly associated with habitat and management features at the site-level. Across the study area, rates of persistence were found to be substantially higer at sites that were subjected to episodic burning and grazing by domestic livestock (mainly sheep). The reason for these observed associations between grazing, fire and persistence of *D. impar* populations is not known with certainty, however it seems likely that appropriate grazing and fire regimes are associated with reduced levels of dominance by invasive plants, and reduced pasture biomass in native grassland habitats. Excessive pasture biomass may be detrimental to *D. impar* due to shading effects on thermoregulatory behaviour, or because thick accumulations of plant biomass limit access to preferred microhabitat such as soil cracks [@howland2014eaten]. In constrast, probabilities of persistence showed no consistent relationship with the amount of grassland habitat present in the landscapes surrounding the sites.

The finding the persistence rates are higher in the presence of grazing and burning points to the possibility of using these actions either alone or in combination as a management tool to reduce the rate at which local populations of *D. impar* go extinct. Unfortunately, the vague and uncertain nature of our current undertanding of the burning and grazing regimes of our study sites limits our ability to make more detailed recommendations regarding the manner in which these management treatments should be applied. Both the fire and grazing data for our study sites were quite vague in nature, being limited to simple qualitative assessments about the frequency of fire, and the presence of grazing. In order to make more definite conclusions about the effect of fire and grazing regimes, much more precise and detailed data are necessary. For fire, this would include information on the frequency, seasonal timing, spatial extent and intensity of burning (both planned and unplanned). The possibility of inferring burning histories from remote-sensed data could be explored, in order to reconstruct fire histories, so as to refine our understanding of preferred burning regimes. For livestock grazing, this would include the frequency, density and seasonality of grazing.

Initial occupancy rates of the study sites increased when there were large areas of native grassland in the vicinity of the study sites, conversely, persistence during the course of the study did not seem to be driven by the amount of grassland. It seems likely that historic fragmentation has already driven populations inhabiting many small grasslands to exinction, with extinction of remaining relictual populations being driven by inappropriate fire and grazing regimes, rather than fragment size.

Thus, it seem that current observed are mainly driven by management regimes, and don't seem to be directly related to fragmentation? Can we interpet this as meaning that there is no longer a significant unpaid extinction debt *sensu* [@tilman1994habitat] attributable to historic habitat fragmentation. The presence of an extinction debt would imply that many currently occupied sites already committed to extinction due to their small habitat area, and therefore small, demographically vulnerable population sizes, which is not supported by the data. Rather, it seemms that the alternative hypothesis that current extinction events mainly a consequence of poor management of otherwise viable populations is a better explanation for current extinction events [@hanski2002extinction; @kuussaari2009extinction].

Amongst our study sites, cases of apparent recolonisation of sites where *D. impar* was absent or had undergone local extinction were comparatively rare. Given the fragmented, and isolated nature of many native grassland remnants in the study area, the rarity of recolonisation is not unexpected. As would be expected where recolonisation is chiefly governed by isolation by distance of adjacent remnant habitat patches, the probability of recolonisation amongst our study sites was strongly and positively influenced by the extent of native grassland habitat in areas surrounding the study sites. Sites with large proportions of native grassland in the immediate vicinity were much more likely to undergo recolonisation, than were small, isolated remnants where available grassland habitat in areas adjacent to a given site were limited or absent.

Prior to European settlement, the native grasslands of southeastern Australia were subject to grazing by native herbivores (mainly Eastern Grey Kangaroos, *Macropus giganteus*) and to fire, either caused by lightning strikes, or deliberately lit by the indigenous people who occupied the area prior to the arrival of Europeans. The intensity and frequency of historic fire and grazing regimes are not known with any accuracy, but it seems probable that both fire and grazing may have played a prominent role in structuring native grassland ecosystems in south-eastern Australia. European settlers largely replaced Kangaroo grazing with domestic sheep, made extensive use of artificial fertilizers, and converted native grasslands to exotic pastures and cropland and suppressed fire within grasslands, although non-productive parts of the landscape (such as roadsides) continue to be frequently burnt as a wildfire prevention strategy. The widespread persistence of *D. impar* on roadside habitats likely stems in part from the partial maintenance of pre-European fire regimes, as well as the less extensive modification and degradation of grasslands in these locations.

Our findings that habitat management influences persistence, and isolation by distance influences on recolonisation have clear conservation and management implications for *D. impar*. Effective conservation of the species as a whole will require that current rates of local extinction are significantly reduced. The apparent association between habitat management regimes and probabilities of persistence allows some tentative exploration of management regimes that could be expanded across the species geographic range in order to improve rates of population persistence. 

Appropriate fire and grazing regimes have been identified in this study as strong influences on probabilities of persistence. Unfortunately, the available data concerning the frequency, intensity and seasonal timing of fire and grazing regimes that were applied to the study sites is limited and uncertain. Knowledge of fire frequency is limited to approximate frequencies of burning supplied by members of volunteer fire brigades who undertake much of the deliberate burning of roadsides and other land in the study area. Similarly, knowledge of grazing regimes was limited simply to whether or not grazing occurred or not, without any reliable information about intensity or frequency. Under these circumstances, the available data are inadequate for assessing more sophisticated hypotheses concerning the appropriate grazing and fire regimes to maximise probabilities of persistence by *D. impar*. In the absence of suitable data to determine the most appropriate fire and grazing regimes, the finding of this study that fire and grazing are positively associated with persistence of *D. impar* needs to be interpreted very cautiously: it is entirely possible that grazing or fire applied to often, too intensely or at the wrong time of year could have a negative impact on the persistence of *D. impar*. An experimental approach to fire and grazing management is therefore to be preferred - sites known to be occupied by *D. impar* could be experimentally subjected to a variety of fire and grazing regimes, and the resulting patterns of persistence would allow preferred management regimes to be identified over time.

The effect of isolation by distance on rates of colonisation presents a more difficult management challenge. Opportunities to decrease current levels of isolation between patches of remnant habitat by habitat restoration are likely to be very limited across much of the species' range. Economically important land-uses such as agriculture and livestock grazing, and urban development lead to large areas of unsuitable habitat, which are for the most part not compatible with management efforts to enhance connectivity between isolated habitat patches by ecosystem restoration. Land-use changes that reduce further connectivity between known areas of suitable habitat should be prevented wherever possible, but it is unlikely that widespread restoration of degraded or destroyed grassland habitat can be used to significantly improve connectivity between currently isolated habitat remnants across large parts of the species' range. 

For some isolated and unoccupied habitat remnants, the feasibility of reintroducing *D. impar* could be explored. Such efforts should be restricted to areas of high quality, well-managed habitat, where persistence of the species is likely in the long term. Introduction of the species to fragments which are small in size, of low habitat quality, or where favourable management regimes cannot be sustained is unlikely to be successful in the long term. The feasability of translocation for establishing new populations of *D. impar* is currently unknown, and would require experimental evaluation to determine it's value as a conservation strategy. For ensuring conservation outcomes for the species as a whole, investment in retention and appropriate management of currently occupied habitat is likely to be much more cost effective than investment in reintroduction actions.

Analysis of the artificial cover object data presented here provides clear guidance regarding appropriate methods for survey and monitoring of *D. impar*. It is clear from the data that probability of detection has strong seasonal variability, with detectability maximised during late Spring and early Summer. Detectability during Winter months is particularly low. Meteorological conditions and time of day were of much more limited significance in determining detectability, suggesting that tile surveys conducted during the appropriate time of year should have high probabilities of detection, irrespective of prevailing weather conditions or time of day. More thorough exploration of the influence of meteorogical factors on the propensity of *D. impar* to utilise under-tile microhabitats using more detailed data on the relationships between multiple meteorogical variables, and the resulting microclimates beneath the roof tiles, possibly using physical models, rather than simple correlative approaches might lead to a better understanding of any underlying relationship between weather and detection.
