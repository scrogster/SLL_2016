# Introduction

The dynamics of patch occupancy within recently fragmented landscapes reflect the collective results of several inter-related ecological processes. Firstly, historical patterns of occupancy in the previously unfragmented landscape provide an upper limit on the extent of initial occupancy (REF). Second, consequent to fragmentation, deterministic loss of initially occupied habitat occurs as habitat is either removed or severely degraded (REF). Third, consequent to fragmentation, populations occupying remaining habitat fragments experience varying probabilities of persistence as a consequence of variation in patch size and quality (REF). Fourth, differential rates of migration into fragments as a consequence of variation in inter-patch differences and matrix permeability to dispersal determine the extent to which vacant fragments can be colonised, and a balance achieved between rates of population extinction and recolonisation (REF).

In addition to these fundamental processes, both theoretical [@tilman1994habitat; @hanski2002extinction; @kuussaari2009extinction] and observational [@helm2006slow; @gu2002estimating; @sang2010indirect; @van2011metapopulation] evidence suggest that in recently fragmented landscapes, there may be a significant delay in extinction processes subsequent to fragmentation, possibly lasting decades or centuries. Such "extinction debts" may result in underestimation of the ultimate impact of fragmentation on species, or a misplaced emphasis on the effects of patch size and quality as mechanisms driving present occupancy, rather than fragmentation and isolation of habitat [@tilman1994habitat; @hanski2002extinction].

By tracking patterns of extinction and colonisation amongst habitat fragments varying in size, quality and connectivity, insight into the processes leading to extinction and colonisation over time can be derived from successive sets of occupancy data [@hanski1999metapopulation; @mackenzie2006occupancy; @heard2012classical; @frey2012relative]. In particular, correlative approaches can be used to determine how initial occupancy states, colonisation and extinction processes are driven by the interplay of habitat extent, quality and connectivity. TODO a bit more detail on dynamic occupancy studies.

Investigations of the spatial dynamics of habitat-specialist species inhabiting recently fragmented landscapes are well suited to resolving the ecological processes determining current and future occupancy in fragmented landscapes. The Striped Legless Lizard (*Delma impar*) occurs primarily within areas of native grasslands on the south eastern Australian mainland (REF), although occurences have been recorded in other vegetation types, including degraded grasslands, grassy woodlands and modified pastures [@dorrough1999; @gemmathesis; @howland2016habitat]. Native grassland was widespread in southeastern Australia at the time of European settlement (c. 180 yr BP), but has been systematically destroyed and degraded through livestock grazing, cultivation, introduction of exotic plant species and urban development (REF). Only a small fraction of the original extent remains, chiefly in the form of small, isolated remnants, most of which are not reserved or managed for conservation. Remnant native grassland continues to be degraded through weed invasion and inappropriate fire, grazing and cultivation regimes (REF). Legal and illegal destruction of remnant grassland also continues, in spite of widespread recognition of the poor conservation status of this vegetation type and it's distinctive biota, and well-established legislative and regulatory frameworks for  protection of remnants [@williams2005fil; @williams2005pta;  @williams2007ela].

The extent of historic destruction and degradation of what was once an essentially a vast contiguous tract of habitat extending across a large portion of southeastern Australia has lead *D. impar* and other grassland-specialist flora and fauna to undergo profound reductions in extent of occurrence [@maldonado2012human] *TODO refs on other spp.*. While it is well established that populations of *D. impar* persist within grassland fragments across the species' historic range, it is not known whether the species is continuing to decline. Furthermore, although it has been hypothesised that inappropriate management and degradation of habitat may adversely effect populations of *D. impar*, formal, quantitative assessment of the habitat and management requirements for ensuring population persistence have not been conducted. Similarly, the extent to which any current (as opposed to historic) declines can be attributed to the size, quality and management of habitat patches, or to population isolation and barriers to dispersal between habitat patches is unknown. Hence, it is difficult to determine how best to prioritise possible management actions so as to maximise the resulting conservation benefits, as the relative contribution of historic fragmentation and current management to any ongoing decline is unknown.

```

We collected occupancy data from (`r jags_dat$tot.sites`) fragments of potential habitat for *D. impar* across south-western Victoria over the course of nine years. Availability of a variety of landscape, habitat and management variables for the sites allowed us to  to test  hypotheses concerning the influence of these factors in determining current occupancy, and probabilities of local extinction and colonisation within the study area. In turn, out long-term, spatially-extensive dataset allows us to elucidate the relative contribution of historic fragmentation and current managemetn to occupancy dynamics, and to identify management actions likely to improve conservation outcomes for the species.

# Methods

## Field data collection

A total of `r jags_dat$tot.sites` sites were selected from the available range of native grassland habitat across each of three Catchment Management Authority (CMA) areas located in western and central Victoria, Australia. Sites included both publicly and privately owned land, and were subject to a range of land management practices. *Garry, please write a couple of sentences here about how the sites were selected, allocation between public, private, grazing other land uses*.  At each site 50 artificial cover objects (ceramic roofing tiles) were deployed in a grid pattern (5 tiles by 10 tiles) spaced at 5 meter intervals. A single site was established in 2003, with monitoring of most of the remaining sites being established during 2004. A few additional sites were added to the study in each subsequent years as time and resources allowed. Most sites were surveyed at least once in every year, while many sites were surveyed multiple times each year. Surveys involved visiting the sites, and lifting each of the 50 tiles in turn. All vertebrate species encountered (mainly reptiles and frogs, but also small mammals such as Dunnarts (*Sminthopsis* spp.)), were captured, identified and immediately released. Occasionally, evidence for the presence of reptiles was obtained from observations of sloughed skins underneath the tiles: where these skins could be identified with certainty they were treated as positive evidence of occupancy. At the time of each survey the following variables were also recorded: Julian date, time of day, air temperature and under-tile soil temperature. It was considered likely that these variables could influence the probability of detecting *Delma impar* during surveys at site where the species was present. This hypothesis was explored as part of the statistical analysis of the survey data (see below).

## Landscape and management variables

A GIS layer of predicted extent of native grassland in Victoria, derived from floristic databases, expert knowledge, and statistical modelling of bioclimatic and remote-sensed variables (reference to grassland DELWP model) was used to estimate the extent of native grassland within a 1000m radius of each monitoring site to provide an estimate of the availability grassland habitat in the landscape surrounding each site.

Detailed data on the history, intensity and frequency of livestock (mainly sheep) grazing at the study sites was unavailable. As an imperfect surrogate for this information, sites were simply classified as grazed or ungrazed, based on observations during the surveys. Similarly, detailed fire history for many of the sites was lacking. We classified the recent fire histories of each sites into three categories: unburnt, burnt once and burnt more than once during the study period. More detailed, historic fire histories were unavailable for most sites. Sites were classified as being managed for conservation if they were located on a formal conservation reserve, or if land managers otherwise reported that the site was managed either partially or wholly for the conservation of *D impar* or other grassland biota.

## Statistical Analysis

### Process model


A Bayesian state-space formulation [@royle2007bss; @roylebook] of the dynamic occupancy model with imperfect detectability [@mackenzie2002; @mackenzie2003] was used to model the ongoing processes of extinction and colonisation that lead to the observed pattern of occupancy amongst the study sites over the course of the the period of observation. The model treats the occupancy states of the $i^{th}$ site during year $t$ (denoted $\mathbf{Z}=z_{i,t}$) as partially-observed, and estimates the missing values based on an integrated model for persistence, colonisation and detection processes. The Bayesian state-space formulation was chosen as it explicitly infers the probabilities of occupancy of each site at each times step, conditional upon the observed data, the model and the priors. Thus it is possible to make explicit probability statements about the occupancy states of either individual sites, or aggregated inferences about the occupancy of groups of sites at any given time [@royle2007bss; @roylebook]. This last feature of the model was of particular utility for inferring the trend in the number of occupied sites, and the numbers of extinction and colonisation events in each year, whilst correctly propagating all modelled sources of uncertainty into the inferences.

At a given site $i$, and time $t$, the probability that the site is occupied is described by a Bernoulli process, with parameter $\psi_{i,t}$:

$$z_{i,t} \sim Bern(\psi_{i,t})$$

The process model for temporal changes in the occupancy status of the sites can be described by the following equation [@royle2007bss; @martin2009pap]:

$$\psi_{i,t}= \phi_{i,t}\psi_{i,t-1}+\gamma_{i,t}(1-\psi_{i,t-1})$$

Where $\psi_{i,t}$ is the probability of occupancy at the $i^{th}$ site at time $t$, $\phi_{t}$ is the probability that the $i^{th}$ occupied site remains occupied between times $t$ and $t-1$, and $\gamma_{i,t}$ is the probability that the $i^{th}$ unoccupied site is colonised between times $t$ and $t-1$.

Initial occupancy proabilities $(\psi_{i,1})$ for each site were modelled as depending on a combination of the extent of remaining grassland habitat in the surrounding landscape, whether the site was currently managed for conservation, and whether the site was subject to livestock grazing. The relationship between these three variables, and the probability of current occupancy was described using a logistic regression model:
$$\log \left(\dfrac{\psi_{i,1}}{1-\psi_{i,1}}\right)=\beta_{1}+\beta_{2}grass_{i}+\beta_{3}conserv_{i}+\beta_{4}graze_{i} $$

We hypothesised that instances of local extinction at any of our study sites would occur either as a consequence of stochastic demographic processes (as expected in small, isolated populations [@hanski1994pmm]), or as a consequence of disturbance, habitat degradation or inappropriate management, to which most sites (irrespective of size) are subject to a varying degree. Population sizes (absolute abundance) for the *Delma impar* populations we studied are unknown, so we used an estimate of the area of suitable habitat (native grassland) available within a radius of 100m around each site as a surrogate for the likely maximum population size, and hence a predictor of rates of stochastic extinction [@hanski1994pmm]. Additional landscape, habitat and management variables were also considered as probable influences on the local extinction probabilities. These habitat/management variables were:  fire frequency, grazing regime and management for conservation:

$$
\begin{aligned}
\log \left(\dfrac{\phi_{i,t}}{1-\phi_{i,t}}\right)=\lambda_{1}+\lambda_{2}grass_{i}+\lambda_{3}fire_{i}+\lambda_{4}graze_{i}+\lambda_{5}conserv_{i}
\end{aligned}
$$

Most of the sites known to be occupied by *Delma impar* are essentially isolated from potential sources of immigration by large areas of unsuitable, highly modified habitats such as cultivated and grazed farmland and assumed barriers such as roads. Hence, colonisation of sites which undergo local extinction is considered unlikely in most cases. We had minimal knowledge regarding the occurence of *D. impar* in areas close to each of the study sites, so the potential for colonisation from neighbouring habitat patches was unknown. The predicted extent of native grassland habitat within a 1000 m circle surrounding each monitoring plot was included in the model as a measure of the extent of neighbouring habitat. It was hypothesised that the occurence of large areas of suitable habitat in close proximity to each monitoring site would increase the probability of colonisation, due to the potential for immigration from adjacent areas of occupied habitat. This effect was modelled by relating the probability of colonisation, $\gamma$ to the area of nearby native grassland habitat using a logistic regression equation:

$$\log \left(\dfrac{\gamma_{i,t}}{1-\gamma_{i,t}}\right)=\delta_{1}+\delta_{2}grass_{i} $$              

### Observation model
For any given site, the probability of detection *Delma impar* duing a single survey was described by a Bernoulli process  with parameter $p_{j}$, conditional on the site being occupied $(z_{i,t}=1)$.  


$$y_{ijt} \sim Bern(p_{j}|z_{i,t}=1)$$

Spatial and temporal heterogeneity in the probability of detecting *D. impar* during surveys (conditional on presence) was modelled by relating the probability of detection, $p_{j}$, to one or more survey-level covariates using a logistic regression equation. Many detections during the course of the study were in the form of observations of sloughed skins underneath roof tiles, rather than observations of actual lizards. It was considered unlikely that detection of sloughs would be influenced by prevailing temperature or time of day, but plausible that detection of sloughs would have a seasonal component which might differ from that applying to actual lizards. Accordingly, the detection model allowed for two distinct forms of detection, with different sets of covariates and differing seasonal patterns for lizards and for sloughs. In both cases, the annual seasonal trend in detection probability was modelled using a series of sine and cosine terms (a second-order Fourier series, [@crespin2002sfb; @heard2015interspecific]). The influences of time-of-day $(t)$; and soil (under tile) temperatures $(T)$ on the probability of detection were modelled using both linear quadratic terms, to allow for possible
curvature in the relationships between these variables and the probability of detection.

For actual lizards, the probability of detection $(p^{liz}_{j})$ was related to the survey-level covariates as follows:

$$
\begin{aligned}
\log \left(\dfrac{p^{liz}_{j}}{1-p^{liz}_{j}}\right) &=\alpha_{1}+ \\
& \phantom{p=} \alpha_{2}\cos2\pi \text{date}_{j}+ \alpha_{3}\sin2\pi \text{date}_{j}+\\
& \phantom{p=} \alpha_{4}\cos4\pi \text{date}_{j}+\alpha_{5}\sin4\pi \text{date}_{j}+ \\
& \phantom{p=} \alpha_{6}t_{j}+\alpha_{7}t_{j}^{2}+
                \alpha_{8}T_{j}+\alpha_{9}T_{j}^{2}
\end{aligned}
$$

For sloughed skins, the probability of detection $(p^{skin}_{j})$ was related to the single covariate (Julian date) as follows. 

$$
\begin{aligned}
\log \left(\dfrac{p^{skin}_{j}}{1-p^{skin}_{j}} \right) &=\alpha_{10}+ \\
& \phantom{p=} \alpha_{11}\cos2\pi \text{date}_{j}+\alpha_{12}\sin2\pi \text{date}_{j}+ \\
& \phantom{p=} \alpha_{13}\cos4\pi \text{date}_{j}+\alpha_{14}\sin4\pi \text{date}_{j}
\end{aligned}
$$

Prior to analysis, Julian dates were tranformed to the interval $[0,1]$, times of day (measured in hours) were centered around midday, and temperatures were centered around the approximate mean value of $22^{\circ}\text{C}$.

Assuming that the two methods of detection were independent of each other, we calculated the overall probability of detection $(p^{total})$ when both methods of detection are applied under the same survey conditions (date, time, temperature etc.) as follows:

$$
p^{total}=1-\left((1-p^{skin})(1-p^{liz})\right)
$$
In order to summarize the changes in occupancy across all `r jags_dat$tot.sites` sites over the course of the study, we also estimated the number of occupied sites at each time step [$N_{t}$,@royle2007bss] from the the time/occupancy state matrix ($\mathbf{Z}$) as follows:

$$
N_{t}=\sum \limits_{i=1}^{i=k} z_{i,t}
$$

and the number of colonisation ($col_{t}$) and extinction ($ext_{t}$) events, and the net change in occupancy ($\Delta N_{t}$) at each time-step as follows:

$$
\begin{aligned}
\text{col}_{t}&=\sum \limits_{i=1}^{i=k} \left(z_{i,t}=1|z_{i,t-1}=0 \right)\\
\text{ext}_{t}&=\sum \limits_{i=1}^{i=k} \left(z_{i,t}=0|z_{i,t-1}=1 \right)\\
\Delta N_{t}&=\text{col}_{t}- \text{ext}_{t}
\end{aligned}
$$


### Fitting the model

The full, integrated model including both the ecological processes (intial occupancy, colonisation and extinction) and observation (detectability) components was estimated from the data using Bayesian Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods. Fitting of the model was carried out using Just Another Gibbs Sampler [@plummer2003jags]. Convergence of the MCMC algorithm was assessed using the Brooks-Gelman-Rubin statistic [@BGR], and by visual inspection of the chain-histories of selected parameters. A burn-in period of `r format(n.burnin, big.mark=",")` iterations of the MCMC algorithm was used to ensure convergence. An additional `r format(n.iter, big.mark=",")` iterations were then generated from each of the `r format(n.chains, big.mark=",")` chains, retaining every `r format(n.thin, big.mark=",")`$^{th}$ iteration for inferences regarding the joint posterior distribution of the parameters, and related derived quantities such as the expected numbers of occupied sites, number of colonisations and number of extinctions at each time-step. Vague (uninformative) priors were specified for the parameters of the model (see model code in Appendix). Uncertainty in our estimates of the number of occupied sites ($N_{t}$), number of colonisation ($\text{col}_{t}$) and number of extinction ($\text{ext}_{t}$) events per time-step, and the net change in occupancy at each time step ($\Delta N_{t}$) was inferred by estimating these quantities at each MCMC updated of the parameters, and calculating summary statistics for the resulting samples from the posteriors of these quantities.

# Results

Over the course of the study, a total of `r jags_dat$tot.surveys` surveys were conducted at the `r jags_dat$tot.sites` survey sites. Survey effort, both in the number of sites surveyed, and the number of surveys per site varied substantially between years, depending on resources available to conduct surveys (Table 1). In each year of monitoring between 65 and 281 sites were surveyed, with at least 217 sites being surveyed in all but the first and last years of the study. The mean number of surveys per site also varied substantially between years, from a minimum of 1.39 surveys per site, to a maximum of 3.63 per site (Table 1). The proportion of surveyed sites that recorded at least one detection of *D. impar* was less than 18.1\% in all but the final year of survey, when 35.4\% of surveyed sites yielded detections of *D. impar*, possibly reflecting preferential sampling of known-occupied sites in the final year of the study.

The state-space analysis of occupancy revealed a decline in the number of occupied sites over the course of the study. At the outset of the study, the state-space model predicted that `r format(startocc[1], digits=3)` (95\% CI: `r format(startocc[3], digits=4)`, `r format(startocc[4], digits=4)`) sites were occupied. This declined to `r format(endocc[1], digits=3)` sites (95\% CI: `r format(endocc[3], digits=4)`, `r format(endocc[4], digits=4)`) in the final year of the study-- an overall loss  of `r format(decline[1], digits=3)` (95\% CI: `r format(decline[3], digits=4)`, `r format(decline[4], digits=4)`) occupied sites over the 9 years of monitoring (Fig. 2). Importantly, the numbers of occupied sites estimated from the state-space model always exceeded the number of sites at which *D. impar* was actually detected during monitoring, highlighting the imperfect and variable detectability of this species.

The observed decline in occupancy was a consequence of the overall rate of population extinctions outstripping the rate at which vacant sites were colonised (Figs. 3-4). The net change in occupancy varied among years, and had high uncertainty (Fig. 4), but was indicative of an annual loss in the number of occupied sites of `r format(-annchange[1], digits=2)` (95\% CI `r format(-annchange[4], digits=2)`, `r format(-annchange[3], digits=4)`) per year.

Occupancy of the study sites at the commencement of the study $(\psi_{1})$ was strongly correlated with the extent of modelled native grassland coverage within a 1000 m radius of the sites (Fig. 5). Management variables (grazing regime and conservation landuse) had a much smaller effect, with some weak evidence that grazing land use led to a greater probability of initial occupancy, and conservation land use led to a lesser probability of initial occupancy (Fig. 5).

Subsequently to the first year of the study, the annual probability that currently occupied sites remain occupied (probability of persistence, $\phi$) was found to be most strongly dependent on the the presence of grazing and fire (Fig. 6). The extent of grassland in the surrounding landscape, and conservation management both had only weak effects on persistence. The effect of surrounding grassland on persistence was also very uncertain (Fig. 6). 

The probability that unoccupied sites would be colonised during the study was found to be strongly and positively associated with the presence of extensive grassland area in the landscape surrounding a site. (Fig. 7.)

Probabilities of detection for both lizards and sloughed skins displayed clear but contrasting annual cycles (Fig. 8). For detection of lizards, there was a distinct peak in detection probability during September--November, with progressively lower detection probabilities through December--August. Detection probabilities of sloughed skins were highest in mid-Summer, only dropping to very low levels during late Winter and early Spring (Fig. 8.). When detection probabilities under the two methods were combined to yield a single probability of detection(see Methods), probabilities of detecting *D impar* at occupied sites were highest during Spring, and progressively decreased through the Summer and Autum, before reaching a minimum during the Winter months (Fig. 8).

After accounting for the seasonal trend in detection proabilities of lizards, there was little evidence for effects of either time of day, or under-tile soil temperatures on the probability of detection. All regression parameters for these effects included zero within their 95\% credible intervals (Table 2).

# Discussion

Our analysis has revealed that over the course of the study, the proportion of sites occupied by *D. impar* has undergone a slow, but steady decline.  The rate of local extinctions outstripped the rate at which unoccupied sites were colonised. If the observed rates of decline at the study sites are consistent with broader trends in occupancy of remnant habitat across the species' range, then a continuing decline in the conservation status of *D. impar* is to be expected.

Although rates of occupancy declined overall, inferred probabilities of persistence ($\psi$) and colonisation ($\gamma$) were not homogenous among sites, and were strongly associated with habitat and management features at the landscape and site levels. Across the study area, rates of persistence were found to be substantially higher at sites that were subjected to episodic burning and grazing by domestic livestock (mainly sheep). The reason for these observed associations between grazing, fire and persistence of *D. impar* populations is not known with certainty, however it seems likely that appropriate grazing and fire regimes are associated with reduced levels of dominance by invasive plants, and reduced pasture biomass in native grassland habitats. Excessive pasture biomass may be detrimental to *D. impar* due to shading effects on thermoregulatory behaviour, or because thick accumulations of plant biomass limits access to preferred microhabitats such as soil cracks [@howland2014eaten; @howland2016habitat]. Pobabilities of persistence showed no consistent relationship with the amount of grassland habitat present in the landscapes surrounding the sites.

The finding the persistence rates are higher in the presence of grazing and burning points to the possibility of using these actions either alone or in combination as a management tool to reduce the rate at which local populations of *D. impar* go extinct. Unfortunately, the vague and uncertain nature of our current undertanding of the burning and grazing regimes at our study sites limits our ability to make more detailed recommendations regarding the manner in which these management treatments should be applied. Both the fire and grazing data for our study sites were quite vague in nature, being limited to simple qualitative assessments about the frequency of fire, and the presence of grazing. In order to make more definite conclusions about the effect of fire and grazing regimes, much more precise and detailed data are necessary. For fire, this would include information on the frequency, seasonal timing, spatial extent and intensity of burning (both planned and unplanned). The possibility of inferring burning histories from remote-sensed data could be explored, in order to reconstruct fire histories, so as to refine our understanding of preferred burning regimes. 

For livestock grazing, data on the frequency, density and seasonality of livestock grazing at the study sites would be required in order to make more rigorous assessments of the relationships between grazing regimes and persistence of *D. impar* [@kay2016effects].

Initial occupancy rates at the study sites increased when there were large areas of native grassland in the vicinity of the study sites. Conversely, persistence during the course of the study did not seem to be driven by the amount of grassland. It seems likely that historic fragmentation has already driven populations inhabiting many small, isolated grasslands to extinction, with extinction of remaining relictual populations now being driven by inappropriate fire and grazing regimes, rather than fragment size.

Thus, it seem that current observed are mainly driven by management regimes, and don't seem to be directly related to fragmentation. *Can we interpet this as meaning that there is no longer a significant unpaid extinction debt [*sensu* @tilman1994habitat] attributable to historic habitat fragmentation?*. The presence of an extinction debt would imply that many currently occupied sites already committed to extinction due to their small habitat area, and therefore small, demographically vulnerable population sizes, but this conclusion is not well supported by our analysis of the monitoring data. Rather, it seems that the alternative hypothesis that current extinction events are mainly a consequence of poor management of otherwise viable populations is a better explanation for recent patch-level extinction events [@hanski2002extinction; @kuussaari2009extinction].

Amongst our study sites, cases of apparent colonisation of sites where *D. impar* was absentwere  comparatively rare. Given the fragmented, and isolated nature of many native grassland remnants in the study area, the rarity of colonisation events is not unexpected. As would be expected where colonisation is chiefly governed by isolation by distance to adjacent remnant habitat, the probability of colonisation amongst our study sites was strongly and positively influenced by the extent of native grassland habitat in areas surrounding the study sites. Sites with large proportions of native grassland in the immediate vicinity were much more likely to undergo colonisation, than were small, isolated remnants where available grassland habitat in areas adjacent to a given site were limited or absent. There is little quantitative data available on dispersal distances for *D. impar*, but based on genetic differentiation of neighbouring populations [@maldonadothesis] and some limited mark-recapture data [@oshea2005thesis] is seems that movements between habitat patches separated by more than a few hundred meters are unlikely. Similarly, there is no available data on the propensity of *D. impar* to move through different kinds of inter-patch matrix, so the permeability of different habitat types and land uses to dispersal, and be extension colonisation of unoccupied habitat is unknown.

Prior to European colonisation, the native grasslands of southeastern Australia were subject to grazing by native herbivores (mainly Eastern Grey Kangaroos, *Macropus giganteus*) and to fire, either caused by lightning strikes, or deliberately lit by the indigenous people who occupied the area prior to the arrival of Europeans [@edney1990late; @crowley1994late]. The intensity and frequency of historic fire and grazing regimes are not known with any accuracy, but it seems probable that both fire and grazing may have played a prominent role in structuring native grassland ecosystems in pre-settlement south-eastern Australia [@morgan1999defining; morgan1999effects; @edney1990late; @crowley1994late]. European colonists largely replaced Kangaroo grazing with domestic sheep, made extensive use of artificial fertilizers, and converted native grasslands to exotic pastures and cropland and suppressed fire within grasslands, although non-productive parts of the landscape (such as roadsides) continue to be frequently burnt as a wildfire prevention strategy. The widespread persistence of *D. impar* on roadside habitats may well stems in part from the partial maintenance of pre-European fire regimes, as well as the less extensive modification and degradation of grasslands in these locations.

Our findings that habitat management influences persistence, and isolation by distance influences colonisation have clear conservation and management implications for *D. impar*. Effective conservation of the species as a whole will require that current rates of local extinction are significantly reduced. The apparent association between habitat management regimes and probabilities of persistence allows some tentative exploration of management regimes that could be expanded across the species geographic range in order to improve rates of population persistence.  Appropriate fire and grazing regimes have been identified in this study as strong influences on probabilities of persistence. Unfortunately, the available data concerning the frequency, intensity and seasonal timing of fire and grazing regimes that were applied to the study sites is limited and uncertain. Knowledge of fire frequency is limited to approximate frequencies of burning supplied by land managers and members of volunteer fire brigades who undertake much of the deliberate burning of roadsides and other land in the study area. Similarly, knowledge of grazing regimes was limited simply to whether or not grazing occurred or not, without any reliable information about intensity or frequency. Under these circumstances, the available data are inadequate for assessing more sophisticated hypotheses concerning the appropriate grazing and fire regimes to maximise probabilities of persistence by *D. impar*. In the absence of suitable data to determine the most appropriate fire and grazing regimes, the finding of this study that fire and grazing are positively associated with persistence of *D. impar* needs to be interpreted very cautiously: it is entirely possible that grazing or fire applied too often, too intensely or at the wrong time of year could have a negative impact on the persistence of *D. impar*. A cautious and experimental approach to fire and grazing management is therefore to be preferred-- sites known to be occupied by *D. impar* could be experimentally subjected to a variety of fire and grazing regimes, and the resulting patterns of persistence would allow preferred management regimes to be identified over time.

The effect of isolation by distance on rates of colonisation presents a more difficult management challenge. Opportunities to decrease current levels of isolation between patches of remnant habitat by habitat restoration are likely to be very limited across much of the species' range. Economically important land-uses such as cropping, livestock grazing, and urban development lead to large areas of unsuitable habitat, which are for the most part not compatible with management efforts to enhance connectivity between isolated habitat patches by ecosystem restoration. Land-use changes that further reduce connectivity between known areas of suitable habitat should be prevented wherever possible, but it is unlikely that widespread restoration of degraded or destroyed grassland habitat can be used to significantly improve connectivity between currently isolated habitat remnants across large parts of the species' range. 

For some isolated and unoccupied habitat remnants, the feasibility of reintroducing *D. impar* could be explored. Such efforts should be restricted to areas of high quality, well-managed habitat, where persistence of the species is likely in the long term. Introduction of the species to fragments which are small in size, of low habitat quality, or where favourable management regimes cannot be sustained is unlikely to be successful in the long term. The feasability of translocation for establishing new populations of *D. impar* is currently unknown, and would require experimental evaluation to determine it's value as a conservation strategy. For ensuring conservation outcomes for the species as a whole, investment in retention and appropriate management of currently occupied habitat is likely to be much more cost-effective than investment in reintroduction actions.

Analysis of the artificial cover object data presented here provides clear guidance regarding appropriate methods for survey and monitoring of *D. impar*. It is clear from the data that probability of detection has strong seasonal variability, with detectability maximised during late Spring and early Summer. Detection probabilities during Winter months are particularly low. Meteorological conditions and time of day were of much more limited significance in determining detectability, suggesting that tile surveys conducted during the appropriate time of year should have high probabilities of detection, irrespective of prevailing weather conditions or time of day. More thorough exploration of the influence of meteorogical factors on the propensity of *D. impar* to utilise under-tile microhabitats using more detailed data on the relationships between multiple meteorogical variables, and the resulting microclimates beneath the roof tiles, possibly using physical models, rather than simple correlative approaches might lead to a better understanding of any underlying relationship between weather and detection.
