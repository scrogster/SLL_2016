# Abstract

1. We monitoring occupancy by the endangered pygopodid lizard *Delma impar* at 291 grassland sites in Western Victoria, Australia for nine years.

2. The monitoring data were analysed using a dynamic occupancy model, which allowed for imperfect detection at occupied sites.

3. At the outset of the study, initial site occupancy was positively associated with the extent of grassland habitat, and the presence of clay-rich soils at sites.

4. Population persistence was associated with the imposition of frequent fire, and grazing (mainly of sheep) at the sites.

5. Colonisation of unoccupied habitat was positively correlated with the extent of remnant native grassland habitat in the landscapes surrounding the sites.

6. Over the course of the study, the number of occupied sites underwent a gradual decline, as rates of colonisation of vacant sites did not balance the rate at which sites went extinct. While colonisation rates appeared to be constant over time, extinctions were especially prevalent early in the first year of the study, which coincided with a period of severe drought in the study area. Rates of extinction were lower later in the study, possibly as a consequence of the drought breaking.

7. Need a point here about management outcomes and recommendations.

# Introduction

The dynamics of patch occupancy within recently fragmented landscapes reflect the collective results of several inter-related ecological processes. Firstly, historical patterns of occupancy in the previously unfragmented landscape provide an upper limit on the extent of initial occupancy (REF). Second, consequent to fragmentation, deterministic loss of initially occupied habitat occurs as habitat is either removed or severely degraded (REF). Third, consequent to fragmentation, populations occupying remaining habitat fragments experience varying probabilities of persistence as a consequence of variation in patch size and quality [(REF)]@rybicki2013species]. Fourth, differential rates of migration into fragments as a consequence of variation in inter-patch distance and permeability of the matrix to dispersal determine the extent to which vacant fragments can be colonised, and either a balance is achieved between rates of population extinction and recolonisation (REF), or ongoing decline to extinction occurs (REF).

Both theoretical [@tilman1994habitat; @hanski2002extinction; @kuussaari2009extinction] and observational [@helm2006slow; @gu2002estimating; @sang2010indirect; @van2011metapopulation] evidence suggest that in recently fragmented landscapes, there may be a significant delay in extinction processes subsequent to fragmentation, possibly lasting decades or centuries. Such "extinction debts" may result in underestimation of the ultimate impact of fragmentation on species, or a misplaced emphasis on the effects of patch size and quality as mechanisms driving present occupancy, rather than fragmentation and isolation of habitat [@tilman1994habitat; @hanski2002extinction].

By tracking patterns of extinction and colonisation amongst habitat fragments varying in size, quality and connectivity, insight into the processes leading to extinction and colonisation over time can be derived from successive sets of occupancy data [@hanski1999metapopulation; @mackenzie2006occupancy; @heard2012classical; @frey2012relative]. In particular, correlative approaches can be used to determine how initial occupancy states, colonisation and extinction processes are driven by the interplay of habitat extent, quality and connectivity. $\color{red}{\text{TODO a bit more detail on dynamic occupancy studies.}}$

Observations of the patch-occupancy dynamics of habitat-specialist species inhabiting recently fragmented landscapes can contribute to resolving the nature and relative importance of ecological processes governing species occupancy in fragmented landscapes. The Striped Legless Lizard (*Delma impar*) occurs primarily within areas of native temperate grasslands on the south-eastern Australian mainland (REF), although occurences have been recorded in other vegetation types, including degraded grasslands, grassy woodlands and modified pastures [@dorrough1999; @gemmathesis; @howland2016habitat]. Native grassland was widespread in south-eastern Australia at the time of European settlement (c. 180 yr BP), but has been systematically destroyed and degraded through livestock grazing, cultivation, introduction of exotic plant species and urban development (REF). Only a small fraction of the original extent remains, chiefly in the form of small, isolated remnants, most of which are not reserved or managed for conservation. Remnant native grassland continues to be degraded through weed invasion and inappropriate fire, grazing and cultivation regimes (REF). Legal and illegal destruction of remnant grassland also continues, in spite of widespread recognition of the poor conservation status of this vegetation type and it's distinctive biota, and well-established legislative and regulatory frameworks for  protection of remnants [@williams2005fil; @williams2005pta;  @williams2007ela].

The extent of historic destruction and degradation of what was once an essentially a large, and essentially contiguous tract of habitat extending across a large portion of south-eastern Australia has lead *D. impar* [@maldonado2012human] and other grassland-specialist flora and fauna to undergo profound reductions in extent of occurrence $\color{red}{\text{TODO refs on other grassland spp}}$. While it is well established that populations of *D. impar* persist within grassland fragments across the species' historic range, it is not known whether the species is continuing to decline. Furthermore, although it has been hypothesised that inappropriate management and degradation of habitat may adversely effect populations of *D. impar*, formal, quantitative assessment of the habitat and management requirements for ensuring population persistence have not been conducted. Similarly, the extent to which any current (as opposed to historic) declines can be attributed to the size, quality and management of habitat patches, or to population isolation and barriers to dispersal between habitat patches is unknown. Hence, it is difficult to determine how best to prioritise possible management actions so as to maximise the resulting conservation benefits, as the relative contribution of historic fragmentation and current management to any ongoing decline is unknown.

We collected occupancy data from `r jags_dat$tot.sites` fragments of potential habitat for *D. impar* across south-western Victoria, Australia over the course of nine years. Availability of a variety of landscape, habitat and management variables for the sites allowed us to  to test  hypotheses concerning the influence of these factors in determining current occupancy, and probabilities of local extinction and colonisation within the study area. In turn, out long-term, spatially-extensive dataset allows us to elucidate the relative contribution of historic fragmentation and current management practices to occupancy dynamics, and to identify changes to management likely to improve conservation outcomes.

# Methods

## Study area and sites

$\color{red}{\text{TODO insert brief description of the study area - climate, geology, vegetation and landuse. Then move on to site definition and description}}$

A total of `r jags_dat$tot.sites` sites were selected from the available range of grassland habitat across each of three Catchment Management Authority (CMA) areas located in western and central Victoria, Australia. The sites included both publicly and privately owned land, and were subject to a range of land management practices. *Garry, please write a couple of sentences here about how the sites were selected, allocation between public, private, grazing other land uses*.  

## Survey techniques

We established an array of 50 artificial cover objects (ceramic roofing tiles) at each site for the purpose of detecting *D. impar*. This species regularly shelters under surface cover, such as exfoliated basalt rocks, and will readily utilise artificial cover objects [@oshea2005thesis; @peterson2010communal; howland2016habitat]. Tiles were deployed in a grid pattern (5 by 10 tiles), spaced at 5 meter intervals. 

Surveys involved visiting a site, and lifting each of the 50 tiles in turn.  Most sites were surveyed at least once per year, with many sites being surveyed multiple times each year. $\color{red}{\text{*TODO insert some stats on this, including some to convey to large amount of data collected*.}}$ All vertebrate species encountered beneath tiles were captured, identified and released. Occasionally, evidence for the presence of *D. impar* was obtained from observations of sloughed skins underneath the tiles: where these skins could be identified with certainty they were treated as evidence of presence. Sloughed skins were removed when detected, to avoid double counting during subsequent surveys at the same site. A few cases of egg-laying beneath tiles were also recorded, and taken as positive evidence of occurence. At the time of each survey the following variables were also recorded: Julian date, time of day, air temperature and under-tile soil temperature. It was considered likely that each of these variables would influence the probability of detecting *D. impar* during tile surveys at sites where the species was present. 

Over the course of the study, a total of `r jags_dat$tot.surveys` surveys were conducted at the `r jags_dat$tot.sites` survey sites. Survey effort, both in the number of sites surveyed, and the number of surveys per site varied substantially between years, depending on resources available to conduct surveys (Table 1). In each year of monitoring between 65 and 281 sites were surveyed, with at least 217 sites being surveyed in all but the first and last years of the study. The mean number of surveys per site also varied substantially between years, from a minimum of 1.39 surveys per site, to a maximum of 3.63 per site (Table 1).

## Landscape and management variables

We hypothesised that instance of local extinction at any of our study sites would occur either as a consequence of stochastic demographic processes [as expected in small, isolated populations; @hanski1994pmm], or as a consequence of disturbance, habitat degradation or inappropriate management, to which most sites (irrespective of size) are subject to varying degrees. Absolute abundances for the *D. impar* populations we studied are unknown, so we used an estimate of the area of surrounding suitable habitat (native grassland) as a surrogate for likely maximum population size, and hence a predictor of extinction risk due to demographic stochasticity [@hanski1994pmm]. A GIS layer of predicted extent of native grassland in Victoria, derived from floristic databases, expert knowledge, and statistical modelling of bioclimatic and remote-sensed variables (reference to grassland DELWP model) was used to estimate the extent of native grassland within a 1000m radius of each monitoring site to provide an estimate of the availability grassland habitat in the landscape surrounding each site.

Published accounts commonly refer to usage of soil cracks as shelter by *D. impar* [@oshea2005thesis] and associations between the presence of the *D. impar* and clay-rich soils with crack-forming characteristics are also reported [@dorrough1999]. As a surrogate for the availability of soil cracks at our sites, we obtained gridded GIS data on soil clay content, developed by the Australian Collaborative Land Evaluation Program (ACLEP), endorsed through the National Committee on Soil and Terrain (http://www.asris.csiro.au/themes/NationalGrids.html).

Additional landscape, habitat and management variables were also considered as determinants of local extinction probabilities due to their effects on population sizes of *D. impar*. We hypothesized that fire frequency and grazing regime would be particular important determinants of local extinction probabilities for this species, based either on existing knowledge of the lizard's biology [@howland2016habitat; @dorrough1999] or the effects of these variables on floristic and structural characteristics of native grasslands in south-eastern Australia [@howland2014eaten; @morgan1999effects]. We classified the fire histories of each site during the course of the study into three categories: unburnt, burnt 1-8 times during the course of the study, or burnt more than eight times. Detailed, historic fire histories were unavailable for most sites, so the extent to which current fire regimes are representative of past fire regimes is unknown. Grazing intensity (mainly due to grazing by domestic sheep, and to a lesser extent domestic cattle, and Eastern Grey Kangaroos, *Macropus giganteus*) was categorised on a simple three-point ordinal scale from no grazing to intense, frequent grazing, based on observations during the study and discussions with land managers. 

Most of the sites known to be occupied by *D. impar* are essentially isolated from potential sources of immigration by large areas of unsuitable, highly modified habitats such as cultivated and grazed farmland, and assumed barriers such as roads. We had minimal knowledge regarding the occurrence of *D. impar* in areas surrounding each of the study sites, so the potential for colonisation from neighbouring occupied habitat was uncertain. The predicted extent of native grassland habitat within a 1000 m radius surrounding each site was hypothesized to represent a useful surrogate of immigration rates and connectivity, and hence, a determinant of colonization probabilities. Estimates of this variable were derived using the above GIS layer of the predicted extent of native grassland in Victoria.

## Statistical Analysis

$\color{red}{\text{*TODO spatial dependence and correlation in process model*}}$

### Process model


A Bayesian state-space formulation [@royle2007bss; @roylebook] of the dynamic occupancy model with imperfect detectability [@mackenzie2002; @mackenzie2003] was used to model the ongoing processes of population extinction and colonisation that lead to the observed pattern of occupancy amongst the study sites over the nin-year survey period. The model treats the occupancy state each site during year $t$ (denoted $\mathbf{Z}=z_{i,t}$) as partially-observed, and estimates the missing values based on an integrated model of the probabilities of populations persistence and colonisation and of detection conditional on presence. The Bayesian state-space formulation was chosen as it explicitly infers the probabilities of occupancy of each site at each times step, conditional upon the observed data, the model and the priors. Thus it is possible to make explicit probability statements about the occupancy states of either individual sites, or aggregated inferences about the occupancy of groups of sites at any given time [@royle2007bss; @roylebook]. This last feature of the model was particularly useful for inferring the trend in the number of occupied sites, and the numbers of extinction and colonisation events in each year, whilst correctly propagating all modelled sources of uncertainty.

At a given site $i$, and year $t$, the probability that the site is occupied is described by a Bernoulli process, with parameter $\psi_{i,t}$:

$$z_{i,t} \sim Bern(\psi_{i,t})$$

The process model for annual changes in the occupancy status of the sites can be described by the following equation [@royle2007bss; @martin2009pap]:

$$\psi_{i,t}= \phi_{i,t}\psi_{i,t-1}+\gamma_{i,t}(1-\psi_{i,t-1})$$

Where $\psi_{i,t}$ is the probability of occupancy at the $i^{th}$ site at time $t$, $\phi_{t}$ is the probability that the $i^{th}$ occupied site remains occupied between times $t$ and $t-1$, and $\gamma_{i,t}$ is the probability that the $i^{th}$ unoccupied site is colonised between times $t$ and $t-1$. 

The Initial occupancy proability at each study site $(\psi_{i,1})$ was modelled as a function of the extent of remaining grassland habitat in the surrounding landscape, the mapped percentage of clay in the soil, and two levels of grazing intensity, representing the presence of light (grazing score 1) or heavy (grazing scores 2 or 3) grazing during the course of the study.

$$\log \left(\dfrac{\psi_{i,1}}{1-\psi_{i,1}}\right)=\beta_{1}+\beta_{2}grass_{i}+\beta_{3}clay_{i}+\beta_{4}graze1_{i}+\beta_{4}graze2_{i} $$

We hypothesised that instances of local extinction at our study sites would occur either as a consequence of stochastic demographic processes relating to population size (for which surrounding grassland extent was considered a useful surrogate) or as a consequence of prevailing fire and grazing regiomes. Hence, the annual probability of population persistence, $\phi$ was modelled as:

$$
\begin{aligned}
\log \left(\dfrac{\phi_{i,t}}{1-\phi_{i,t}}\right)=\lambda_{1}+\lambda_{2}grass_{i}+\lambda_{3}fire1_{i}+\lambda_{4}fire2_{i}+\lambda_{5}graze1_{i} + \lambda_{6}graze2_{i} 
\end{aligned}
$$
The variables $fire1$ and $fire2$ were indicator variables representing low and high fire frequencies, which were defined respectively as being between 1 and 8 fires over the course of the study, and >8 fires over the course of the study.

The annual probability of colonisation of vacant sites was modelled purely as a function of the the predicted extent of native grassland habitat within a 1000 m radius, which, as above, was an hypothesised surrogate for landscape connectivity for *D. impar* in the study area:

$$\log \left(\dfrac{\gamma_{i,t}}{1-\gamma_{i,t}}\right)=\delta_{1}+\delta_{2}grass_{i} $$   

### Accounting for site clustering
Some survey grids were located in close proximity to each other, meaning that the processes of occupancy, persistence and colonisation could not reasonably be treated as independent at neighbouring sites. For the purposes of the analysis, sites located within 1000 m of each other were treated as belonging to a cluster, and normally distributed cluster-level random effects terms were included in the model to allow for dependence in the observation of sites located in the same cluster.


### Observation model
For any given site, the probability of detecting *D. impar* during a single survey was described by a Bernoulli process  with parameter $p_{j}$, conditional on the site being occupied during the year of the survey $(z_{i,t}=1)$.  


$$y_{ijt} \sim Bern(p_{j}|z_{i,t}=1)$$

Spatial and temporal heterogeneity in the probability of detecting *D. impar* during surveys (conditional on presence) was modelled as a function of survey-level covariates. Many detections during the course of the study were in the form of observations of sloughed skins, and in a very few cases eggs underneath roof tiles, rather than observations of actual lizards. It was considered unlikely that detection of sloughs (or eggs) would be influenced by prevailing temperature or time of day, but plausible that detection of sloughs would have a seasonal component which might differ from that applying to actual lizards. Accordingly, the detection model allowed for two distinct forms of detection, with different sets of covariates and differing seasonal patterns for lizards and for sloughs (and eggs). In both cases, the annual seasonal trend in detection probability was modelled using a series of sine and cosine terms (a second-order Fourier series, @crespin2002sfb; @heard2015interspecific). The influences of hour-of-day $(h)$; and soil (under tile) temperatures $(T)$ on the probability of detection were modelled using both linear quadratic terms, to allow for possible curvature in the relationships between these variables and the probability of detection. We also hypothesised that lizards may be more likely to use tiles, when temperatures below the tiles were warmer than the ambient temperature. Therefore, we included the difference between the under-tile and air temperature $(\Delta T)$ as a predictor of detecetion

For actual lizards, the probability of detection $(p^{liz}_{j})$ was therefore related to the survey-level covariates as follows:

$$
\begin{aligned}
\log \left(\dfrac{p^{liz}_{j}}{1-p^{liz}_{j}}\right) &=\alpha_{1}+ \\
& \phantom{p=} \alpha_{2}\cos2\pi \text{date}_{j}+ \alpha_{3}\sin2\pi \text{date}_{j}+\\
& \phantom{p=} \alpha_{4}\cos4\pi \text{date}_{j}+\alpha_{5}\sin4\pi \text{date}_{j}+ \\
& \phantom{p=} \alpha_{6}h_{j}+\alpha_{7}h_{j}^{2}+
                \alpha_{8}T_{j}+\alpha_{9}T_{j}^{2}+ \alpha_{10}\Delta T
\end{aligned}
$$

For sloughed skins and eggs, the probability of detection $(p^{skin}_{j})$ was related to a single covariate (Julian date) as follows. 

$$
\begin{aligned}
\log \left(\dfrac{p^{skin}_{j}}{1-p^{skin}_{j}} \right) &=\alpha_{10}+ \\
& \phantom{p=} \alpha_{11}\cos2\pi \text{date}_{j}+\alpha_{12}\sin2\pi \text{date}_{j}+ \\
& \phantom{p=} \alpha_{13}\cos4\pi \text{date}_{j}+\alpha_{14}\sin4\pi \text{date}_{j}
\end{aligned}
$$

Prior to analysis, Julian dates were tranformed to the interval $[0,1]$, times of day (measured in hours) were centered around midday, and temperatures were centered around the approximate mean value of $22^{\circ}\text{C}$.

Assuming that the two methods of detection were independent of each other, we calculated the overall probability of detection $(p^{total})$ when both methods of detection are applied under the same survey conditions (date, time, temperature etc.) as follows:

$$
p^{total}=1-\left((1-p^{skin})(1-p^{liz})\right)
$$
In order to summarize the changes in occupancy across all `r jags_dat$tot.sites` sites over the course of the study, we also estimated the number of occupied sites at each time step [$N_{t}$,@royle2007bss] from the the latent occupancy states ($\mathbf{Z}$) of the state-space model as follows:

$$
N_{t}=\sum \limits_{i=1}^{i=k} z_{i,t}
$$

and the number of colonisation ($col_{t}$) and extinction ($ext_{t}$) events, and the net change in occupancy ($\Delta N_{t}$) at each time-step as follows:

$$
\begin{aligned}
\text{col}_{t}&=\sum \limits_{i=1}^{i=k} \left(z_{i,t}=1|z_{i,t-1}=0 \right)\\
\text{ext}_{t}&=\sum \limits_{i=1}^{i=k} \left(z_{i,t}=0|z_{i,t-1}=1 \right)\\
\Delta N_{t}&=\text{col}_{t}- \text{ext}_{t}
\end{aligned}
$$
For each of the above quantities, uncertainty in the inferences was described by calculating each quantity from each estimate of model's parameters generated by the MCMC algorith used to fit the model (see below).

### Fitting the model

The full, integrated model was fitted to the data using Bayesian Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods. Fitting of the model was carried out using Just Another Gibbs Sampler, version 4.1.0 [@plummer2003jags]. Convergence of the MCMC algorithm was assessed using the Brooks-Gelman-Rubin statistic [@BGR], and by visual inspection of the chain-histories of selected parameters. A burn-in period of `r format(n.burnin, big.mark=",")` iterations of the MCMC algorithm was used to ensure convergence. An additional `r format(n.iter, big.mark=",")` iterations were then generated from each of the `r format(n.chains, big.mark=",")` chains, retaining every `r format(n.thin, big.mark=",")`$^{th}$ iteration for inferences regarding the joint posterior distribution of the parameters, and related derived quantities such as the expected numbers of occupied sites, number of colonisations and number of extinctions at each time-step (see above). Following gelman2006prior and @gelman2008weakly, vaguely informative Cauchy(0, 2.5) priors were specified for the regression parameters of the model, and half-Cauchy(0, 25) priors were specified for the standard deviations of the cluster-level random effects. Code used to fit the model is provided in the Appendix.

*Delma impar* was detected at least once at `r colSums(z.init, na.rm=TRUE)[1]` of the `r tapply(jags_dat$site, jags_dat$t, function(x) length(unique(x)))[1]` sites surveyed in the first year of this study (Figure 2), an observed prevalence of `r format(100*colSums(z.init, na.rm=TRUE)[1]/291, digits=3)`% (Figure 2). The observed (naive) prevalence  of *D. impar* in each year averaged `r format(100*mean(colSums(z.init, na.rm=TRUE))/291, digits=2)`%, fluctuating between `r format(100*min(colSums(z.init, na.rm=TRUE))/291, digits=2)`% and `r format(100*max(colSums(z.init, na.rm=TRUE))/291, digits=2)`%. Occupancy modelling suggest that the number of occupied sites declines over the course of the study from `r format(startocc[1], digits=3)` (95\% CI: `r format(startocc[3], digits=4)`, `r format(startocc[4], digits=4)`) to `r format(endocc[1], digits=3)` sites (95\% CI: `r format(endocc[3], digits=4)`, `r format(endocc[4], digits=4)`) in the final year of the study (an overall loss  of `r format(decline[1], digits=3)` (95\% CI: `r format(decline[3], digits=4)`, `r format(decline[4], digits=4)` occupied sites over the 9 years of monitoring; Fig. 2).

The probability of site occupancy in the first year ($\psi_{1}$) was positively associated with the extent of modelled native grassland within a 1000 m radius of the sites and the proportion of clay in the soil (Figure 5). The prevailaing grazing regime had a much smaller effect with little evidence for either a negative or positive effect of grazing intensity on $\psi_{1}$ (Fig. 5).

The observed decline in occupancy was a consequence of population extinctions outstripping colonizations of vacant sites (Figs. 3-4). The net change in occupancy varied among years, (and had high uncertainty, Fig. 4), but averaged a loss of `r format(-annchange[1], digits=2)` (95\% CI `r format(-annchange[4], digits=2)`, `r format(-annchange[3], digits=4)`) sites per annum.

The annual probability of populations persistence, ($\phi_{t}$) was most strongly correlated with grazing and fire frequency (Fig. 6). Both low and high frequencies of fire, and low and high intensities of grazing resulted in higher probabilities of persistence than regimes where fire and grazing were totally excluded (Fig. 6). The extent of grassland in the surrounding landscape had little effect on persistence (Fig. 6). 

The annual probability of colonisation of unoccupied sites ($\gamma_{t}$) was strongly and positively correlated with grassland area in the surrounding (1000 m radius) landscape. (Fig. 7.)

Probabilities of detecting both lizards and sloughed skins displayed clear but contrasting annual cycles (Fig. 8). For lizards, there was a distinct peak in detection probability between September and November (i.e. the Austral spring), with progressively lower detection probabilities from December through to August. Detection probabilities of sloughed skins were highest in mid-Summer (December--January), dropping to very low levels between Winter and early Spring (June--September, Fig. 8.). Combined, the probabilities of detectin *D. impar* by any method peaked during Spring, and progressively decreased through Summer and Autumn, before reaching a minimum during the winter months (Fig. 8).

After accounting for the seasonal trend in detection proabilities of lizards, there was little evidence for effects of either time of day, or under-tile soil temperatures on the probability of detection. All regression parameters for these effects included zero in their 95\% credible intervals (Table 2). There was a weakly positive effect of the air-soil Temperature differential $(\Delta T)$ on the probability of detecting lizards, with a slight increase in probability of detection when under-tile temperatures were greater than ambient air temperatures (Table 2).

# Discussion

Our analysis has revealed that over the course of the study, the proportion of sites occupied by *D. impar* has undergone a slow, but steady decline.  The rate of local extinctions outstripped the rate at which unoccupied sites were colonised. If the observed rates of decline at the study sites are consistent with broader trends in occupancy of remnant habitat across the species' range, then a continuing decline in the conservation status of *D. impar* is likely to be expected.

Although rates of occupancy declined overall, inferred probabilities of persistence ($\psi$) and colonisation ($\gamma$) were not homogenous among sites, and were associated with habitat and management features at the landscape and site levels. Across the study area, rates of persistence were found to be substantially higher at sites that were subjected to episodic burning and grazing by domestic livestock (mainly sheep). While the underlying ecological mechanisms for these relationships require further study, the observed associations between grazing, fire and persistence of *D. impar* populations may have resulted from reduced levels of dominance by invasive plants in appropriately grazed and/or burnt grassland, and reduced pasture biomass. Excessive pasture biomass may be detrimental to *D. impar* due to shading effects on thermoregulatory behaviour, or because thick accumulations of plant biomass limits access to preferred microhabitats such as soil cracks [@howland2014eaten; @howland2016habitat]. $\color{red}{\text{TODO discuss possible impact of veg overgrowth on food supply and invertebrate assemblages (is there any published data on this?).}}$ Probabilities of persistence showed little relationship with the amount of grassland habitat present in the landscapes surrounding the sites. $\color{red}{\text{TODO expand this point}}$.

The finding that probabilities of persistence are higher in the presence of grazing and burning points to the possibility of using these actions either alone or in combination as a management tool to reduce the rate at which local populations of *D. impar* go extinct. Our results provide clear evidence that applying appropriate fire and grazing regimes can effectively increase the probability that local populations of *D. impar* persist in grassland remnants. In order to make more definite conclusions about the effect of fire and grazing regimes, more precise and detailed data are necessary. For fire, this would include information on the frequency, seasonal timing, spatial extent and intensity of burning (both planned and unplanned).  

Amongst our study sites, cases of apparent colonisation of sites where *D. impar* was absent were rather rare. However, as would be expected  in a system where colonisation if chiefly governed by distance to adjacent remnant habitat, the probability of colonisation at our study sites was strongly and positively influenced by the extent of native grassland habitat in the surrounding landscape. While little is know about movement patterns and home range sizes of *the Striped Legless Lizard *D. impar*, there is evidence that it is a sedentary species [@coulson1990conservation; @kutt1992microhabitat; @dorrough1999]. While movements of up to 60 m have been recorded during the mating period [@kutt1992microhabitat; @kukolic1994survey], recapture data from @oshea2005thesis suggests very small home ranges are typical (<10 m^2). Recent genetic results also indicate very limited dispersal distances (Maldonado et al. 2012). It seems that movements between habitat patches separated by more than a few hundred meters are unlikely, which severely limits the capacity for *D. impar* to recolonise vacant habitat from adjacent, occupied habitat. 

Prior to European colonisation, the native grasslands of south-eastern Australia were subject to grazing by native herbivores (mainly Eastern Grey Kangaroos, *Macropus giganteus* and other macropods) and to fire, either caused by lightning strikes, or deliberately lit by indigenous people [@edney1990late; @crowley1994late]. Both fire and grazing played a prominent role in structuring native grassland ecosystems in pre-settlement south-eastern Australia [@morgan1999defining; @morgan1999effects; @edney1990late; @crowley1994late]. European colonists largely replaced native grazing animals with domestic sheep and invasive European rabbits (*Oryctolagus cuniculus*), made extensive use of artificial fertilizers, and converted native grasslands to exotic pastures and cropland and suppressed fire within grasslands. Non-productive parts of the landscape, such as roadsides, continue to be frequently burnt as a wildfire prevention strategy). The widespread persistence of *D. impar* on roadside habitats may well stems in part from the partial maintenance of pre-European fire regimes, as well as the less extensive modification and degradation of grasslands in these locations. $\color{red}{\text{TODO introduce discussion or roadsides a bit earlier, and possibly make this explicit in the analysis}}$.

Our findings that habitat management influences persistence, and habitat fragmentation influences colonisation have clear conservation and management implications for *D. impar*. The apparent association between habitat management regimes and probabilities of persistence allows some intial direction in selecting management regimes that could be expanded across the species geographic range in order to improve rates of population persistence. The finding that persistence is more likely at sites that are burnt or grazed, points towards a need to impose these management actions more widely. An important question for future research on the management of *D. impar*, is to identify the most appropriate fire and grazing regimes. Our finding  that fire and grazing are positively associated with persistence of *D. impar* needs to be applied cautiously by managers: it is entirely possible that grazing or fire applied too often, too intensely or with incorrect seasonal timing would have a negative effects on the persistence of *D. impar* populations. An experimental approach to fire and grazing management is therefore required-- sites known to be occupied by *D. impar* could be experimentally subjected to a variety of fire and grazing regimes, and the resulting patterns of persistence would allow superior management regimes to be identified over time.

The effect of fragmentation on rates of colonisation presents a more difficult management challenge. Opportunities to decrease current levels of isolation between patches of remnant habitat by habitat restoration are likely to be severely limited across much of the species' range. Economically important land-uses such as cropping, livestock grazing, and urban development lead to large areas of unsuitable habitat, which are for the most part not compatible with management efforts to enhance connectivity between isolated habitat patches by ecosystem restoration. Land-use changes that further reduce connectivity between known areas of suitable habitat should be prevented wherever possible, but it is unlikely that widespread restoration of degraded or destroyed grassland habitat can be used to significantly improve connectivity between currently isolated habitat remnants across large parts of the species' range. 

For some isolated and unoccupied habitat remnants, the feasibility of reintroducing *D. impar* could be explored. Such efforts should be restricted to areas of high quality, well-managed habitat, where persistence of the species is likely in the long term. As our model allows the prediction of probabilities of persistence from habitat and management variables, it could be used to prioritise sites for reintroduction, based on their estimated probabilities of persistence.  Introduction of the species to fragments which are small in size, of low habitat quality, or where favourable management regimes cannot be sustained is unlikely to be successful. The feasability of translocation for establishing new populations of *D. impar* is currently unknown, and would require experimental evaluation to determine it's value as a conservation strategy. For ensuring conservation outcomes for the species as a whole, investment in retention and appropriate management of currently occupied habitat is likely to be much more cost-effective than investment in reintroduction actions, given the generally low success rates of reintroduction programs for threatened reptiles [@germano2009suitability; @dodd1991relocation].

Analysis of the artificial cover object data presented here provides clear guidance regarding appropriate methods for survey and monitoring of *D. impar*. The results of our analysis make it clear that probability of detection has strong seasonal variability, with detection maximised during late spring and early summer. Detection probabilities during the winter months are particularly low. Meteorological conditions and time of day were of much more limited significance in determining detectability, suggesting that tile surveys conducted during the appropriate time of year should have high probabilities of detection, irrespective of prevailing weather conditions or time of day.
