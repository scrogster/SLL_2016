The majority of work undertaken during this investigation was conducted as part of an honours research project. The molecular investigation look at the current management groups of SLL and assessed how they actually relate to the species phylogeography and in particular, whether specific molecular ""Evolutionary Significant Units"" and/or ""Management Units"" exist. The project also examined factors such as dispersal between populations and genetic stochastic effects in small and isolated populations. Ethics approval and permits to removal the last 10mm of tail from a subset of individuals for molecular tissue was sought and granted. A number of tails were removed during spring monitoring while skins were also collected as they could be used as a source of DNA. A presentation on the preliminary results of this project was given to the Striped Legless Lizard Working Group in January 2009 and an honours thesis was submitted for examination in May 2009. The results from this project indicate that there are four different lineages across the species range: ACT/NSW, Central Victoria, Western Victoria and Horsham/South Australia lineage. The four distinct lineages had high levels of genetic divergence suggesting that they have been isolated from one another for more than one million years, and hence these lineages should be considered as separate Evolutionarily Significant Units for management purposes. Microsatellite analyses did not reveal strong evidence of population sub-structuring due to recent anthropogenic fragmentation within the Western Victoria lineage, but the analyses did suggest that SLL may not be capable of dispersing over long distances.",

The data has been analysed at ARI to determine detection probabilities for SLL and also to assess potential covariates that may influence detectability. The analysis of the monitoring data has indicated that detection rates of SLL using artificial cover objects (i.e. tiles) are highest in October and November. During this period, multiple surveys are nevertheless required in order to achieve adequate overall probabilities of detection (>0.95). Detection rates during other times of the year can be much lower, and hence the total survey effort required during those periods will be higher - e.g. 20 surveys per site would be needed if survey work were conducted during July. Temperature and time of day had limited influence on detection. A draft paper is currently being written and further analysis examining the influence of habitat variables on occupancy is being completed. These results will form the basis of a survey and monitoring protocol for SLL that will be utilised Australia wide by both government agencies and environmental consultancies.

The results of the habitat modelling will also allow us to determine sites where the species may be present but until now have not been surveyed. These sites will be ground truthed and surveyed using our standard methodologies in 2009/10. Further analysis will also be undertaken in collaboration with ARI in the form of the development of an occupancy model for SLL and further habitat predictive models.",

The majority of work undertaken during this investigation was conducted as part of an honours research project. The molecular investigation look at the current management groups of SLL and assessed how they actually relate to the species phylogeography and in particular, whether specific molecular ""Evolutionary Significant Units"" and/or ""Management Units"" exist. The project also examined factors such as dispersal between populations and genetic stochastic effects in small and isolated populations. Ethics approval and permits to removal the last 10mm of tail from a subset of individuals for molecular tissue was sought and granted. A number of tails were removed during spring monitoring while skins were also collected as they could be used as a source of DNA. A presentation on the preliminary results of this project was given to the Striped Legless Lizard Working Group in January 2009 and an honours thesis was submitted for examination in May 2009. The results from this project indicate that there are four different lineages across the species range: ACT/NSW, Central Victoria, Western Victoria and Horsham/South Australia lineage. The four distinct lineages had high levels of genetic divergence suggesting that they have been isolated for one another for more than one million years, and hence these lineages should be considered as separate Evolutionarily Significant Units for management purposes. Microsatellite analyses did not reveal strong evidence of population sub-structuring due to recent anthropogenic fragmentation within the Western Victoria lineage, but the analyses did suggest that SLL may not be capable of dispersing over long distances.",

Partially completed results are as follows, Grazing has been excluded and regulated at a number of sites since the beginning of this project. The D. impar monitoring data and vegetation monitoring data need to be assessed to determine if any responses to the change in grazing regimes has taken place. Further vegetation monitoring was undertaken at a number of sites during spring. Results from the recent collaborative honours project with Ballarat University found the SLL was more often found at sites with a combination of grazing and conservation than at sites dominated by grazing or managed with little to no grazing. This indicates that some intermediate level of stock grazing to reduce biomass is beneficial to SLL.

The data has been analysed at ARI to determine detection probabilities for SLL and also to assess potential covariates that may influence detectability. The analysis of the monitoring data has indicated that detection rates of SLL using artificial cover objects (i.e. tiles) are highest in October and November. During this period, multiple surveys are nevertheless required in order to achieve adequate overall probabilities of detection (>0.95). Detection rates during other times of the year can be much lower, and hence the total survey effort required during those periods will be higher - e.g. 20 surveys per site would be needed if survey work were conducted during July. Temperature and time of day had limited influence on detection. A draft paper is currently being written and further analysis examining the influence of habitat variables on occupancy is being completed.

The majority of work undertaken during this investigation was conducted as part of an honours research project. The molecular investigation look at the current management groups of SLL and assessed how they actually relate to the species phylogeography and in particular, whether specific molecular ""Evolutionary Significant Units"" and/or ""Management Units"" exist. The project also examined factors such as dispersal between populations and genetic stochastic effects in small and isolated populations. Ethics approval and permits to removal the last 10mm of tail from a subset of individuals for molecular tissue was sought and granted. A number of tails were removed during spring monitoring while skins were also collected as they could be used as a source of DNA. A presentation on the preliminary results of this project was given to the Striped Legless Lizard Working Group in January 2009 and an honours thesis was submitted for examination in May 2009. The results from this project indicate that there are four different lineages across the species range: ACT/NSW, Central Victoria, Western Victoria and Horsham/South Australia lineage. The four distinct lineages had high levels of genetic divergence suggesting that they have been isolated for one another for more than one million years, and hence these lineages should be considered as separate Evolutionarily Significant Units for management purposes. Microsatellite analyses did not reveal strong evidence of population sub-structuring due to recent anthropogenic fragmentation within the Western Victoria lineage, but the analyses did suggest that SLL may not be capable of dispersing over long distances.",

This project found that the presence/absence of the SLL is strongly associated with the extent of grassy native vegetation and temperature and geology. The findings from this project will be used to model potential D. impar habitats for conservation and planning purposes. The results of the habitat modelling will also allow us to determine sites where the species may be present but until now have not been surveyed. These sites will be ground truthed and surveyed using our standard methodologies in 2009/10. Further analysis will also be undertaken in collaboration with ARI in the form of the development of an occupancy model for SLL and further habitat predictive models.,

The data has been analysed at ARI to determine detection probabilities for SLL and also to assess potential covariates that may influence detectability. The analysis of the monitoring data has indicated that detection rates of SLL using artificial cover objects (i.e. tiles) are highest in October and November. During this period, multiple surveys are nevertheless required in order to achieve adequate overall probabilities of detection (>0.95). Detection rates during other times of the year can be much lower, and hence the total survey effort required during those periods will be higher - e.g. 20 surveys per site would be needed if survey work were conducted during July. Temperature and time of day had limited influence on detection. A draft paper is currently being written and further analysis examining the influence of habitat variables on occupancy is being completed. These results will form the basis of a survey and monitoring protocol for SLL that will be utilised Australia wide by both government agencies and environmental consultancies. A presentation of the current results was give at the SLL Working Group Meeting in December 2009. ",

The majority of work undertaken during this investigation was conducted as part of an honours research project. The molecular investigation look at the current management groups of SLL and assessed how they actually relate to the species phylogeography and in particular, whether specific molecular ""Evolutionary Significant Units"" and/or ""Management Units"" exist. The project also examined factors such as dispersal between populations and genetic stochastic effects in small and isolated populations. Ethics approval and permits to removal the last 10mm of tail from a subset of individuals for molecular tissue was sought and granted. A number of tails were removed during spring monitoring while skins were also collected as they could be used as a source of DNA. A presentation on the preliminary results of this project was given to the Striped Legless Lizard Working Group in January 2009 and an honours thesis was submitted for examination in May 2009. The results from this project indicate that there are four different lineages across the species range: ACT/NSW, Central Victoria, Western Victoria and Horsham/South Australia lineage. The four distinct lineages had high levels of genetic divergence suggesting that they have been isolated for one another for more than one million years, and hence these lineages should be considered as separate Evolutionarily Significant Units for management purposes. Microsatellite analyses did not reveal strong evidence of population sub-structuring due to recent anthropogenic fragmentation within the Western Victoria lineage, but the analyses did suggest that SLL may not be capable of dispersing over long distances.",

The Shire will be collating a formal report of the progress of the Enforcable Undertaking for the Federal and State government in 2013. The reason why the project is still running and there is money left over, is for two reasons. First, the project was meant to be completed in 2011, the reason why it is still running is because it started a year later than what it was meant to. There is still money left over because the native regrowth after the area was cleaned up was extremely successful. Since then the money for weed control could only be spent based on the amount of weed control required and the seasons. ",

The use of tiles in the hot dry climate during summer was not determined to be satisfactory.  Tiles became too hot and few animals sought refuge under them. twp types of tile were used - the more traditional masonry tile and a light-weight non-masnry tile.  The heavier masonry tile had better insulation properties but held the heat for longer, while the lighter tile cooled down faster. An alternative is being investigated using remote camera surveillance equipment being obtained by Parks Victoria, and for experimental sites to be established in the Terrick cluster area.",
